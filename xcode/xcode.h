   @defgroup xcode

   xcode module implements a modest set of introspection facilities. A user
   defines a structure (m0_xcode_type) which describes the in memory layout of a
   C data-type. xcode provides interfaces to iterate over hierarchy of such
   descriptors and to associate user defined state with types and fields.

   A motivating example of xcode usage is universal encoding and decoding
   interface (m0_xcode_decode(), m0_xcode_encode(), m0_xcode_length()) which
   converts between an in-memory object and its serialized representation.

   Other usages of xcoding interfaces are:

       - pretty-printing,

       - pointer swizzling and adjustment when loading BE segments into memory,

       - consistency checking: traversing data-structures in memory validating
         check-sums and invariants.

   Not every C data-structure can be represented by xcode. The set of
   representable data-structures is defined inductively according to the
   "aggregation type" of data-structure:

       - ATOM aggregation type: scalar data-types void, uint8_t, uint32_t and
         uint64_t are representable,

       - RECORD aggregation type: a struct type, whose members are all
         representable is representable,

       - UNION aggregation type: a "discriminated union" structure of the form

         @code
         struct {
                 scalar_t discriminator;
	         union {
	                 ...
	         } u;
         };
         @endcode

         where scalar_t is one of the scalar data-types mentioned above and all
         union fields are representable is representable,

       - SEQUENCE aggregation type: a "counted array" structure of the form

         @code
         struct {
                 scalar_t  nr;
		 el_t     *el;
         };
         @endcode

         where scalar_t is one of the scalar data-types mentioned above and el_t
         is representable,

       - ARRAY is a fixed size array

         @code
         struct {
		 el_t el[N];
         };
         @endcode

	 where N is a compile-time constant and el_t is representable.

       - OPAQUE aggregation type: pointer type is representable when it is used
         as the type of a field in a representable type and a special function
         (m0_xcode_field::xf_opaque()) is assigned to the field, which returns
         the representation of the type of an object the pointer points to.

         The usage of function allows representation of pointer structures where
         the actual type of the object pointed to depends on the contents of its
         parent structure.

   A representable type is described by an instance of struct m0_xcode_type,
   which describes type attributes and also contains an array
   (m0_xcode_type::xct_child[]) of "fields". A field is represented by struct
   m0_xcode_field and describes a sub-object. The field points to a
   m0_xcode_type instance, describing the type of sub-object. This way a
   hierarchy (forest of trees) of types is organized. Its leaves are atomic
   types.

   Sub-objects are located contiguously in memory, except for SEQUENCE elements
   and OPAQUE fields.

   xcode description of a data-type can be provided either by

       - manually creating an instance of m0_xcode_type structure, describing
         properties of the data-type or

       - by tagging C structure declarations with macros defined in
         xcode/xcode.h and then executing xcode/m0gccxml2xcode on the header file
         or

       - by creating a description of the desired serialized format of a
         data-type and using ff2c translator (xcode/ff2c/ff2c.c) to produce C
         files (.c and .h) containing the matching data-type definitions and
         xcode descriptors.

   The first method is suitable for memory-only structures. The last 2 methods
   are for structures designed to be transmitted over network of stored on
   persistent storage (fops, db records, &c.). m0gccxml2xcode is the preferable
   method. ff2c should only be used when m0gccxml2xcode cannot accomplish the
   task.

   Encoding-decoding (collectively xcoding) support is implemented on top of
   introspection facilities provided by the xcode module. xcoding provides 3
   operations:

       - sizing (m0_xcode_length()): returns the size of a buffer sufficient to
         hold serialized object representation;

       - encoding (m0_xcode_encode()): constructs a serialized object
         representation in a given buffer;

       - decoding (m0_xcode_decode()): constructs an in-memory object, given its
         serialized representation.

   xcoding traverses the tree of sub-objects, starting from the topmost object
   to be xcoded. For each visited object, if a method, corresponding to the
   xcoding operation (encode, decode, length) is not NULL in object's type
   m0_xcode_type_ops vector, this method is called and no further processing of
   this object is done. Otherwise, "standard xcoding" takes place.

   Standard xcoding is non-trivial only for leaves in the sub-object tree (i.e.,
   for objects of ATOM aggregation type):

       - for encoding, place object's value into the buffer, convert it to
         desired endianness and advance buffer position;

       - for decoding, extract value from the buffer, convert it, store in the
         in-memory object and advance buffer position;

       - for sizing, increment required buffer size by the size of atomic type.

   In addition, decoding allocates memory as necessary.
