/**
   @defgroup processor Processor Information

   Interfaces to learn the number and characteristics of "processors"
   for a given system/node.

   @section Definitions

   @subsection Processor
   It's a logical processor. This may mean HT or core inside a physical
   CPU package. It depends on a given OS kernel. HT is the finest
   granularity processing unit at hardware level.

   @subsection Possible-Processors
   Maximum number of processors that can be attached to this OS.

   @subsection Available-Processors
   The number of processors that are currently configured or available under
   this OS. Please note that all the processors may not be enabled or used
   by OS.

   @subsection Online-Processors
   The number of processors that are currently enabled/under use/online under
   this OS.
