   @defgroup thread Thread

   Thread creation and manipulation interface (rather spartan at the moment).

   Threads can be created that will start execution by running a specified
   function invoked with a specified argument. Thread functions return void, a
   user must arrange a method of transferring results back from the thread if
   necessary.

   The only operation on a started thread is waiting for its completion
   ("joining" the thread).

   Control block for a thread.

   <b>States</b>

   A thread control block can be in one of the following states:

   @li PARKED: thread is not yet started or has been joined already. In this
   state m0_thread::t_func is NULL;

   @li RUNNING: the thread started execution of m0_thread::t_func function, but
   hasn't yet been joined. Note that the thread can be in this state after
   return from m0_thread::t_func.

   <b>Concurrency control</b>

   A user is responsible for serialising access to a control block. For example,
   there should be no concurrent calls to m0_thread_init() or m0_thread_join()
   for the same m0_thread.

   <b>Liveness</b>

   Implementation only accesses control block as part of explicit calls to
   m0_thread interface functions. A user is free to destroy the control block at
   any moment, except for the possible resource leak in the case of running (and
   not yet joined) thread.
