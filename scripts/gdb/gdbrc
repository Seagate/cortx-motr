# gdb startup script for "wrapper" execution.
#
# Use this as gdb startup script, for example:
#
#     export GDBPARAMS="-x $PWD/scripts/gdb/gdbrc"; ./utils/m0run -dgdb m0ut -- ...
#
# The script runs the executable. If the executable completes normally (that is,
# by calling exit(2)) the scripts exits the gdb. Otherwise (i.e., when the
# process terminates abnormally), gdb session remains active.
