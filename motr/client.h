 * @defgroup client
 *
 * Overview
 * --------
 *
 * Examples of Motr applications are:
 *
 *     - Motr file system client (m0t1fs);
 *
 *     - Lustre osd-motr module (part of LOMO);
 *
 *     - Lustre HSM backend (part of Castor-A200);
 *
 *     - SWIFT or S3 backend (part of WOMO);
 *
 *     - Motr-based block device (part of BOMO);
 *
 *     - exascale E10 stack (see eiow.org).
 *
 * Client interface is divided into the following sub-interfaces:
 *
 *     - access sub-interface, which provides basic abstraction to build storage
 *       application;
 *
 *     - management sub-interface, which provides methods for Motr cluster
 *       deployment, configuration, re-configuration and monitoring;
 *
 *     - extension sub-interface, which allows applications to extend Motr
 *       functionality without modifying the core Motr.
 *
 * This header describes the access sub-interface of client, simply called
 * "client interface" hereafter.
 *
 * In the following "an application" means a code invoking the client interface
 * and "the implementation" refers to the implementation of the said interface.
 *
 * Client provides the following abstractions:
 *
 *     - object (m0_obj) is an array of fixed-size blocks;
 *
 *     - index (m0_idx) is a key-value store;
 *
 *     - realm (m0_realm) is a spatial and temporal part of system with a
 *       prescribed access discipline. Objects, indices and operations live in
 *       realms;
 *
 *     - operation (m0_op) is a process of querying or updating system
 *       state;
 *
 * Realms are further sub-divided in:
 *
 *     - transaction (m0__dtx) is a collection of operations atomic in the
 *       face of failures;
 *
 *     - epoch (m0_epoch) is a collection of operations done by an
 *       application, which moves the system from one application-consistent
 *       state to another;
 *
 *     - container (m0_container) is a collection of objects used by a
 *       particular application or group of applications;
 *
 *     - other types of realms, as can be added in the future.
 *
 * Object, index and realm are sub-types of entity (m0_entity). Entities
 * provide state, interface and behavior shared by all sub-types.
 *
 * All client entry points, except for m0_op_wait(), are non-blocking.
 * To perform a potentially lengthy activity, that might involve network
 * communication (for example, read from an object), the client entry point
 * (m0_obj_op() in the case of object read), sets up an operation
 * (m0_ops) structure containing the parameters of the activity and
 * immediately returns to the caller. The caller should explicitly launch a set
 * of previously prepared operations by calling m0_op_launch().
 * Separation of preparation and launch provides for more efficient network
 * communication, where multiple operations are accumulated in the same network
 * message.
 *
 * In-memory structures (m0_{obj,index,realm,...}) correspond to some
 * storage entities maintained by the implementation. The implementation does
 * not enforce this correspondence. If an application keeps multiple in-memory
 * structures for the same storage entity (whether in the same process address
 * space or not), it is up to the application to keep the structures coherent
 * (the very notion of coherency, obviously, being application-dependent). At
 * the one end of the spectrum, an application can employ a fully coherent,
 * distributed cache for entities, providing strong consistency guarantees. On
 * the other end, an application can tolerate multiple inconsistent views of the
 * same storage entities, providing NFSv2-like semantics.
 *
 * Sub-typing
 * ----------
 *
 * @verbatim
 *
 *        entity (create, delete, open, close, fini) [abstract, no constructor]
 *          |
 *          |
 *          +---- object (init, read, write, alloc, free)
 *          |
 *          |
 *          +---- index (init, get, put, next)
 *          |
 *          |
 *          +---- realm () [abstract, no constructor]
 *                  |
 *                  |
 *                  +---- container (init)
 *                  |
 *                  |
 *                  +---- epoch (init)
 *                  |
 *                  |
 *                  +---- dtx (init)
 *
 *
 *        op (init, wait, setup, launch, kick, free, fini)
 *           [has private sub-types in private.h]
 *
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * Identifiers
 * -----------
 *
 * An entity exists in some realm and has a 128-bit identifier, unique within
 * the cluster and never re-used. The high 8 bits of an identifier denote the
 * entity type. Identifier management is up to the application, except that the
 * single identifier M0_UBER_REALM is reserved for the "uber realm",
 * representing the root of the realm hierarchy, and within each entity type,
 * identifiers less than M0_ID_APP are reserved for the implementation's
 * internal use.
 *
 * @todo A library on top of client for fast scalable identifier allocation will
 * be provided as part of Motr.
 *
 * The implementation is free to reserve some 8-bit combinations for its
 * internal use.
 *
 * @todo an interface to register 8-bit combinations for application use (to
 * introduce application-specific "entity-like" things).
 *
 * Operations
 * ----------
 *
 * An operation structure tracks the state of execution of a request made to the
 * implementation.
 *
 * An operation structure is a state machine going through states described by
 * enum m0_op_state:
 *
 * @verbatim
 *                                  (0)
 *                                   |
 *                                   |
 *                                   V
 *              +---------------INITIALISED
 *              |                    |
 *              |                    | m0_op_launch()
 *              V                    V
 *           FAILED<-------------LAUNCHED
 *              ^                    |
 *              |                    |
 *              |                    V
 *              +----------------EXECUTED---------------->STABLE
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * An operation in INITIALISED, FAILED or STABLE state is called "complete" and
 * "outstanding" (or "in-progress") otherwise.
 *
 * An operation is in INITIALISED state after allocation. In this state, the
 * operation processing is not yet started, the application is free to modify
 * operation parameters with a call to m0_op_setup() or direct field
 * access.
 *
 * Multiple initialised operation structures can be simultaneously moved to the
 * LAUNCHED state, by a call to m0_op_launch(). This call starts actual
 * operation processing. No changes to the operation structure are allowed by
 * the application after this call is made and until the operation completes.
 * To improve caching and utilisation of system resources, the implementation
 * is free to delay any operation-related acitivities, such as sending network
 * messages, for some time after the operation is launched. The value of
 * m0_op::op_linger is an application-provided hint about the absolute
 * time by which such delays should be limited.
 *
 * In case of successful execution, a launched operation structure eventually
 * reaches EXECUTED state, meaning that the operation was executed at least in
 * the volatile stores of the respective services. When the operation enters
 * EXECUTED state, the m0_op_ops::oop_executed() call-back, if provided
 * by the application, is invoked. By the time this state is entered, the
 * operation return code is in m0_op::op_sm::sm_rc, and all return
 * information (object data in case of READ, keys and values in case of GET and
 * NEXT) are already placed in the application-supplied buffers.
 *
 * After an operation has been executed, it can still be lost due to a
 * failure. The implementation continues to work toward making the operation
 * stable. When this activity successfully terminates, the operation enters the
 * STABLE state and the m0_op_ops::oop_stable() call-back is invoked, if
 * provided. Once an operation is stable, the implementation guarantees that the
 * operation would survive any "allowed failure", where allowed failures include
 * at least transient service failures (crash and restart with volatile store
 * loss), transient network failures and client failures.
 *
 * In case of a failure, the operation structure moves into FAILED state, the
 * m0_op_ops::oop_failed() call-back is invoked, and no further state
 * transitions will ensue.
 *
 * The implementation is free to add another states to the operation state
 * machine.
 *
 * All operation structures embed "generic operation" m0_op as the first
 * member.
 *
 * The application can track the state of the operation either synchronously, by
 * waiting until the operation reaches a particular state (m0_op_wait()),
 * or asynchronously by supplying (m0_op_setup()) a call-back to be
 * called when the operation reaches a particular state.
 *
 * Operation structures are either pre-allocated by the application or allocated
 * by the appropriate entry points, see the "op" parameter of m0_obj_op()
 * for an example. When an operation structure is pre-allocated, the application
 * must set m0_op::op_size to the size of the pre-allocated structure
 * before passing it to a client entry point. This allows the implementation to
 * check that the pre-allocated structure has enough room and return an error
 * (-EMSGSIZE) otherwise.
 *
 * Operation errors are returned through m0_op::op_sm::sm_rc.
 *
 * Operations, common for all entity types are implemented at the entity level:
 * m0_entity_create(), m0_entity_delete(),
 * m0_entity_fini().
 *
 * A typical usage would involve initialisation of a concrete entity (e.g.,
 * object), execution of some generic operations and then of some concrete
 * operations, for example:
 *
 * @code
 * m0_obj  o;
 * m0_op  *ops[2] = {};
 *
 * // initialise object in-memory structure.
 * m0_obj_init(&o, &container, &id, 0);
 *
 * // initiate object creation. m0_entity_create() allocated the
 * // operation and stores the pointer to it in ops[0].
 * m0_entity_create(NULL, &o.ob_entity, &ops[0]);
 *
 * // initiate write data in the object.
 * result = m0_obj_op(&o, M0_OC_WRITE, ..., &ops[1]);
 *
 * // launch both operations (creation and write)
 * m0_op_launch(ops, ARRAY_SIZE(ops));
 *
 * // wait until creation completes
 * result = m0_op_wait(op[0], M0_BITS(M0_OS_STABLE,
 *                                    M0_OS_FAILED),
 *                                    M0_TIME_NEVER);
 * // wait until write completes
 * result = m0_op_wait(op[1], M0_BITS(M0_OS_STABLE,
 *                                    M0_OS_FAILED),
 *                                    M0_TIME_NEVER);
 * // finalise the object
 * m0_entity_fini(&o.ob_entity);
 *
 * // free the operations
 * m0_op_free(op[0]);
 * m0_op_free(op[1]);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Object
 * ------
 *
 * A client object is an array of blocks, which can be read from and written
 * onto at the block granularity.
 *
 * Block size is a power of two bytes and is selected at the object creation
 * time.
 *
 * An object has no traditional application-visible meta-data (in particular, it
 * has no size). Instead it has meta-data, called "block attributes" associated
 * with each block. Block attributes can be used to store check-sums, version
 * numbers, hashes, etc. Because of the huge number of blocks in a typical
 * system, the overhead of block attributes book-keeping must be kept at a
 * minimum, which puts restrictions on the block attribute access interface
 * (@todo to be described).
 *
 * There are 4 types of object operations, in addition to the common entity
 * operations:
 *
 *     - READ: transfer blocks and block attributes from an object to
 *       application buffers;
 *
 *     - WRITE: transfer blocks and block attributes from application buffers to
 *       an object;
 *
 *     - ALLOC: pre-allocate certain blocks in an implementation-dependent
 *       manner. This operation guarantees that consecutive WRITE onto
 *       pre-allocated blocks will not fail due to lack of storage space;
 *
 *     - FREE: free storage resources used by specified object
 *       blocks. Consecutive reads from the blocks will return zeroes.
 *
 * READ and WRITE operations are fully scatter-gather-scatter: data are
 * transferred between a sequence of object extents and a sequence of
 * application buffers, the only restrictions being:
 *
 *     - total lengths of the extents must be equal to the total size of the
 *       buffers, and
 *
 *     - extents must be block-size aligned and sizes of extents and buffers
 *       must be multiples of block-size.
 *
 * Internally, the implementation stores an object according to the object
 * layout (specified at the object creation time). The layout determines
 * fault-tolerance and performance related characteristics of the
 * object. Examples layouts are:
 *
 *     - network striping with parity de-clustering. This is the default layout,
 *       it provides a flexible level of fault-tolerance, high availability in
 *       the face of permanent storage device failures and full utilisation of
 *       storage resources;
 *
 *     - network striping without parity (raid0). This provides higher space
 *       utilisation and lower processor costs than parity de-clustering at the
 *       expense of fault-tolerance;
 *
 *     - network mirroring (raid1). This provides high fault-tolerance and
 *       availability at the cost of storage space consumption;
 *
 *     - de-dup, compression, encryption.
 *
 * Index
 * -----
 *
 * A client index is a key-value store.
 *
 * An index stores records, each record consisting of a key and a value. Keys
 * and values within the same index can be of variable size. Keys are ordered by
 * the lexicographic ordering of their bit-level representation. Records are
 * ordered by the key ordering. Keys are unique within an index.
 *
 * There are 4 types of index operations:
 *
 *     - GET: given a set of keys, return the matching records from the index;
 *
 *     - PUT: given a set of records, place them in the index, overwriting
 *       existing records if necessary, inserting new records otherwise;
 *
 *     - DEL: given a set of keys, delete the matching records from the index;
 *
 *     - NEXT: given a set of keys, return the records with the next (in the
 *       ascending key order) keys from the index.
 *
 * Indices are stored according to a layout, much like objects.
 *
 * Realm
 * -----
 *
 * To define what a realm is, consider the entire history of a client storage
 * system. In the history, each object and index is represented as a "world
 * line" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_line), which starts when the
 * entity is created and ends when it is deleted. Points on the world line
 * correspond to operations that update entity state.
 *
 * A realm is the union of some continuous portions of different world
 * lines. That is, a realm is given by a collection of entities and, for each
 * entity in the collection, a start and an end point (operations) on the
 * entity world line. A realm can be visualised as a cylinder in the history.
 *
 * The restriction placed on realms is that each start point in a realm must
 * either be the first point in a world line (i.e., the corresponding entity is
 * created in the realm) or belong to the same realm, called the parent of the
 * realm in question. This arranges realms in a tree.
 *
 * @note Realms are *not* necessarily disjoint.
 *
 * A realm can be in the following application-controllable states:
 *
 *     - OPEN: in this state the realm can be extended by executing new
 *       operations against entities already in the realm or creating new
 *       entities in the realm;
 *
 *     - CLOSED: in this state the realm can no longer be extended, but it is
 *       tracked by the system and maintains its identity. Entities in a closed
 *       realm can be located and read-only operations can be executed on them;
 *
 *     - ABSORBED: in this state the realm is no longer tracked by the
 *       system. All the operations executed as part of the realm are by now
 *       stable and absorbed in the parent realm;
 *
 *     - FAILED: an application aborted the realm or the implementation
 *       unilaterally decided to abort it. The operations executed in the realm
 *       are undone together with a transitive closure of dependent operations
 *       (the precise definition being left to the implementation
 *       discretion). Thus, failure of a realm can lead to cascading failures of
 *       other realms.
 *
 * Examples of realms are:
 *
 *     - a container (m0_container) can be thought of as a "place" where
 *       a particular storage application lives. In a typical scenario, when an
 *       application is setup on a system, a new container, initially empty,
 *       will be created for the application. The application can create new
 *       entities in the container and manipulate them without risk of conflicts
 *       (e.g., for identifier allocation) with other applications. A container
 *       can be thought of as a virtualised storage system for an application. A
 *       container realm is open as long as application needs its persistent
 *       data. When the application is uninstalled, its realm is deleted;
 *
 *     - a snapshot realm is created with a container as the parent and is
 *       immediately closed. From now on, the snapshot provides a read-only view
 *       of container objects at the moment of the snapshot creation. Finally,
 *       the snapshot is deleted. If a snapshot is not closed immediately, but
 *       remains open, it is a writeable snapshot (clone)---a separate branch in
 *       the container's history. A clone is eventually deleted without being
 *       absorbed in the parent container;
 *
 *     - an epoch (m0_epoch) is a realm capturing part of the
 *       application's work-flow for resilience. Often an HPC application works
 *       by interspersing "compute phases", when actual data processing is done,
 *       with an "IO phase" when a checkpoint of application state is saved on
 *       the storage system for failure recovery purposes. A client application
 *       would, instead, keep an open "current" epoch realm, closed at the
 *       compute-IO phase transition, with the new epoch opened immediately. The
 *       realm tree for such application would look like
 *
 * @verbatim
 *
 *     CONTAINER--->E--->E---...->E--->CURRENT
 *
 * @endverbatim
 *
 *       Where all E epochs are closed and in the process of absorbtion, and all
 *       earlier epochs already absorbed in the container.
 *
 *       If the application fails, it can restart either from the container or
 *       from any closed epoch, which are all guaranteed to be consistent, that
 *       is, reflect storage state at the boundry of a compute phase. The final
 *       CURRENT epoch is potentially inconsistent after a failure and should be
 *       deleted.
 *
 *     - a distributed transaction (m0__dtx) is a group of operations,
 *       which must be atomic w.r.t. to failures.
 *
 * Ownership
 * ---------
 *
 * client entity structures (realms, objects and indices) are allocated by the
 * application. The application may free a structure after completing the
 * corresponding finalisation call. The application must ensure that all
 * outstanding operations on the entity are complete before finalisation.
 *
 * An operation structure allocated by the application, must remain allocated
 * until the operation is complete. Before a complete operation structure can be
 * re-used, it should be finalised by a call to m0_op_fini(). An
 * operation structure allocated by the client implementation can be finalised
 * and re-used as one allocated by the application, and must be eventually freed
 * by the application (by calling m0_op_free()) some time after the
 * operation completes.
 *
 * Data blocks used by scatter-gather-scatter lists and key-value records are
 * allocated by the application. For read-only operations (M0_OC_READ,
 * M0_IC_GET and M0_IC_NEXT) the application may free the data
 * blocks as soon as the operation reaches EXECUTED or FAILED state. For
 * updating operations, the data blocks must remain allocated until the
 * operation stabilises.
 *
 * Concurrency
 * -----------
 *
 * The client implementation guarantees that concurrent calls to the same index
 * are linearizable.
 *
 * All other concurrency control, including ordering of reads and writes to a
 * client object, and distributed transaction serializability, is up to the
 * application.
 *
 * For documentation links, please refer to this file :
 * doc/motr-design-doc-list.rst
 *
 * @todo entity type structures (to provide constructors, 8-bit identifier tags
 * and an ability to register new entity types).
 *
 * @todo handling of extensible attributes (check-sums, version numbers, etc.),
 * which require interaction with the implementation on the service side.

 * Resource Manager(RM) Object Locks
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Resource: is an entity in Motr for which a notion of ownership can be
 *           well-defined.
 * Resource Manager: is a service which manages the granting and revocation
 *                   of resources to and from clients and services.
 * Objects: are resources for the Resource Manager(RM).
 * Remote RM creditor: is the RM service running on a remote server.
 * Borrowing: the rights to use the resource from remote RM,
 *           'locks' the object.
 * Relinquishing: the rights to use the resource to remote RM, 'unlocks'
 *                the object.
 * Write Locks: behave like mutexes and maintain mutual exclusion.
 * Read Locks: facilitate shared access to the object made by other requests.
 * Lock conflict: When a request for lock has to wait for other lock request(s)
 *                to release the lock.
 * Fairness: Object lock maintains fairness among lock requests by enforcing
 *           FCFS among lock requests (Note: fairness can be guaranteed if the
 *           clocks are synchronized among RM services).
 *
 * The object can be locked with exclusive access by using write
 * locks and shared access by using read locks. An object locked with write
 * lock cannot be locked by other lock requests and any subsequent requests
 * for locks will conflict. An object locked with read lock will not conflict
 * with other subsequest read locks.
 *
 * To maintain fairness and prevent writer starvation, any read lock requests
 * made after the arrival of a write lock request, will wait and wont bypass
 * FCFS ordering to acquire lock.
 *
 * @verbatim
 *     type of lock held    |   new request for lock   |    conflict?
 * -------------------------+--------------------------+-----------------
 *           Write          |           Write          |       Yes
 *           Write          |           Read           |       Yes

 *
 * There is no restriction on the granularity of locks on application level.
 *
 * The RM context (represented by m0_rm_lock_ctx) holds information
 * about the object which is needed by the RM to lock/unlock this object,
 * and act as a local owner for the object.
 *
 * The RM context is cached in client instance to avoid multiple
 * initializations. It is created and initialized on the first call
 * of m0_obj_lock_init for a particular object and upon subsequent calls
 * for the same object, it takes a reference of cached RM context and attaches
 * it to the instance of the object.
 *
 * In single threaded environment, it's recommended that the object lock is
 * initialized only once, followed by a sequence of lock and unlock before
 * finalizing the lock.
 *
 * In multi-threaded environment, every in-memory instance of the same object
 * should be initialised local to the thread. They will share the same instance
 * of RM context which is cached in client instance. The usage is same as with
 * single threaded environment after initialization.

/**
 * Initialises an index operation.
 *
 * For M0_IC_NEXT operation arguments should be as follows:
 * - 'keys' buffer vector first element should contain a starting key and other
 *   elements should be set to NULL. Buffer vector size indicates number of
 *   records to return.
 *   Starting key can be NULL. In this case starting key is treated as the
 *   smallest possible key of the index. If starting key doesn't exist in the
 *   index, then retrieved records will start with the smallest key following
 *   the starting key. Otherwise, a record corresponding to the starting key
 *   will be included in a result.
 * - 'vals' vector should be at least of the same size as 'keys' and should
 *   contain NULLs. After successful operation completion retrieved index
 *   records are stored in 'keys' and 'vals' buffer vectors. If some error
 *   occurred during i-th index record retrieval then rcs[i] != 0. -ENOENT error
 *   means that there are no more records to return.
 *
 * For M0_IC_GET operation arguments should be as follows:
 * - 'keys' buffer vector should contain keys for records being requested.
 *   At least one key should be specified and no NULL keys are allowed.
 * - 'vals' vector should be at least of the same size as 'keys' and should
 *   contain NULLs. After successful operation completion retrieved record
 *   values are stored in 'vals' buffer vector. If some value retrieval has
 *   failed, then corresponding element in 'rcs' array != 0.
 *
 * 'rcs' holds array of per-item return codes for the operation. It should be
 * allocated by user with a size of at least 'keys->ov_vec.v_nr' elements. For
 * example, 6 records with keys k0...k5 were requested through GET request with
 * k3 being absent in the index. After operation completion rcs[3] will be
 * -ENOENT and rcs[0,1,2,4,5] will be 0.
 *
 * Per-item return codes are more fine-grained than global operation return
 * code (op->op_sm.sm_rc). On operation completion the global return code
 * is set to negative value if it's impossible to process any item (invalid
 * index fid, lost RPC connection, etc.).
 * - If the operation global return code is 0, then user should check per-item
 *   return codes.
 * - If the operation global return code is not 0, then per-item return codes
 *   are undefined.
 *
 * 'rcs' argument is mandatory for all operations except M0_IC_LOOKUP.
 *
 * For M0_CLOVIC_IC_PUT flags argument may be set.
 * - 'flags' is a bit-mask of m0_op_idx_flags enum. M0_OIF_OVERWRITE and
 *   M0_OIF_SYNC_WAIT are supported for now.
 *   If M0_OIF_OVERWRITE flag is set then records with existing keys are
 *   overwritten, otherwise operation returns -EEXIST for existing keys.
 *   If M0_OIF_SYNC_WAIT flag is set then it ensures that reply would be sent
 *   only when transaction is persisted. This flag can only be used
 *   with M0_IC_PUT or M0_IC_DEL.
