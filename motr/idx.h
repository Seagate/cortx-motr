/**
 * A client index is a key-value store.
 *
 * An index stores records, each record consisting of a key and a value. Keys
 * and values within the same index can be of variable size. Keys are ordered by
 * the lexicographic ordering of their bit-level representation. Records are
 * ordered by the key ordering. Keys are unique within an index.
 *
 * There are 4 types of index operations:
 *
 *     - GET: given a set of keys, return the matching records from the index;
 *
 *     - PUT: given a set of records, place them in the index, overwriting
 *       existing records if necessary, inserting new records otherwise;
 *
 *     - DEL: given a set of keys, delete the matching records from the index;
 *
 *     - NEXT: given a set of keys, return the records with the next (in the
 *       ascending key order) keys from the index.
 *
 * @todo Currently, the user can specify only one start key for NEXT operation,
 * not a set.
 *
 * Generally, the client implementation doesn't guarantee that concurrent calls
 * to the same index are linearizable. But in some configurations there is such
 * a guarantee, e.g. for non-distributed indices with Motr DIX service.
 * See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearizability.
 *
 * Client doesn't assume any relationship between index and container. A
 * container can have any number of indices and have to manage them itself.
 * In some cases, multiple containers can even share index.
 *
 * Actual key-value storage functionality is provided by client index back-end
 * service. All existing services are enumerated in m0_idx_service_type.
