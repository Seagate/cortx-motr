/**
 * @defgroup conf-pvers
 *
 * There are 3 kinds of m0_conf_pver objects: actual, formulaic, virtual.
 * Of those only actual and formulaic pvers are 1) linked to the DAG of
 * conf objects, 2) specified in configuration strings (conf.xc files),
 * and 3) exist in memory of confd service.
 *
 * When HA state of a device[1] changes, flset_hw_obj_failure_cb() updates
 * recd[2] vectors of the actual pvers, whose objvs refer to this device.
 *
 *   [1] Here "device" is m0_conf_{rack,enclosure,controller,disk},
 *       i.e., an object which m0_conf_objv::cv_real may refer to.
 *
 *   [2] "recd" is acronym of "racks, enclosures, controllers, disks".
 *
 * The attributes of an actual pver:
 *   - pvs_recd[]: number of failed (i.e., non-M0_NC_ONLINE) devices
 *     at each level of this pver's subtree;
 *   - pvs_sitevs;
 *   - pvs_attr;
 *   - pvs_tolerance[]: this attribute is used by failure domains code
 *     (fd/fd.c) and is opaque for conf code.
 *
 * Formulaic pvers are "leaves" of conf DAG --- they do not have a subtree
 * of objvs growing from them.  The attributes of a formulaic pver are:
 *   - pvf_id: cluster-unique identifier;
 *   - pvf_base: reference to the actual pver, the subtree of which is used
 *     to create/restore virtual pver subtree;
 *   - pvf_allowance[]: number of non-M0_NC_ONLINE objects at each level of
 *     base pver subtree.
 *
 * When configuration consumer needs a pool version, it calls
 * m0_conf_pver_find(), passing m0_conf_pool as an argument. The function
 * searches for a "clean" pver among m0_conf_pool::pl_pvers ---
 * the one for which m0_conf_pver_is_clean() returns true.
 *
 * An actual pver is clean iff all its objvs refer to M0_NC_ONLINE objects.
 *
 * A formulaic pver is clean iff the number of failed devices at level L
 * of the base pver's subtree is equal to L-th element of the allowance
 * vector, where L = 0..M0_CONF_PVER_LVL_DRIVES.
 *
 * Clean actual pver is returned (by m0_conf_pver_find()) to user as is.
 * Clean formulaic pver is used to find or create virtual pver;
 * see conf_pver_formulate().
 *
 * Virtual pver resembles actual pver in that it also has a subtree of objvs
 * growing from it.  Differences:
 *   - virtual pver is not linked to the DAG of conf objects (i.e., its
 *     m0_conf_obj::co_parent is NULL);
 *   - virtual pver and its children (m0_conf_dirs and m0_conf_objvs)
 *     exist in local conf cache only.  They are never transferred over
 *     network, are not represented in conf strings, do not exist in confd's
 *     conf cache.
 *
 * Fid of virtual pver contains all the information necessary to
 * restore virtual pver subtree (e.g., in case of node restart).
 * m0_conf_pver_find_by_fid() finds or re-creates virtual pool version
 * by its fid.
 *
 * To generate or parse m0_conf_pver fid, use m0_conf_pver_fid() and
 * m0_conf_pver_fid_read(), correspondingly.
 *
 * <hr> <!----------------------------------------------------------->
 * @section conf-pvers-assume Design Assumptions
 *
 * m0_conf_pver_find() assumes that all conf objects of the subtree,
 * originating at `pool' argument, exist in the conf cache and are
 * M0_CS_READY.
 *
 * m0_conf_pver_find_by_fid() assumes M0_CS_READY-ness of all conf objects,
 * whose type is not m0_conf_{node,process,service,sdev}.
