 * @page rconfc-fspec Redundant Configuration Client (rconfc)
 *
 * Redundant configuration client library -- rconfc -- provides an interface for
 * Motr applications working in cluster with multiple configuration servers
 * (confd).
 *
 * Rconfc supplements confc functionality and processes situations when cluster
 * dynamically changes configuration or loses connection to some of confd
 * servers.
 *

 * - @ref rconfc_dfspec "Detailed Functional Specification"
 *
 * <hr> <!------------------------------------------------------------>
 * @section rconfc-fspec-data Data Structures
 * - m0_rconfc --- an instance of redundant configuration client.
 *
 * m0_rconfc structure includes a dedicated m0_confc instance
 * m0_rconfc::rc_confc, which is intended for conventional configuration
 * reading.
 *
 * Beside of that, it contains two lists of confc instances, the one used for
 * communication with multiple confd servers in cluster environment during
 * configuration version election, and the other one used for keeping list of
 * discovered confd servers that run the same version that has won in the most
 * recent election.
 *
 * <hr> <!------------------------------------------------------------>
 * @section rconfc-fspec-sub Subroutines
 *
 * - m0_rconfc_init() initialises rconfc internals.
 *
 * - m0_rconfc_start() carries out configuration version election. During
 *   election all known confd servers are polled for a number of version they
 *   run. The elected version, i.e. the version having the quorum, is used in
 *   further configuration reading operation. In case quorum is reached,
 *   m0_rconfc connects the dedicated m0_rconfc::rc_confc to one of the confd
 *   servers from active list.
 *
 * - m0_rconfc_start_sync() is synchronous version of m0_rconfc_start().
 *
 * - m0_rconfc_stop() disconnects dedicated confc and release other internal
 *   resources.
 *
 * - m0_rconfc_stop_sync() is synchronous version of m0_rconfc_stop().
 *
 * - m0_rconfc_fini() finalises rconfc instance.
 *
 * - m0_rconfc_ver_max_read() reports the maximum configuration version number
 *   the confd servers responded with during the most recent version election.
 *
 * <hr> <!------------------------------------------------------------>
 * @section rconfc-fspec-routines Initialisation, finalisation and reading data
 *
 * To access configuration data the configuration consumer is allowed to follow
 * two different scenarios:
 *
 * - reading with standalone configuration client (confc)
 * - reading with confc exposed from redundant configuration client (rconfc)
 *
 * In the first case the consumer reads data from particular confd server
 * with no regard to whether its version reached quorum or not.
 *
 * In the second case the consumer is guaranteed to read data from configuration
 * that reached the quorum in the cluster, i.e. the most recent consistent
 * one. As well, the consumer is guaranteed to be notified about the fact of
 * configuration change, to let accommodate with the change if required. In
 * addition, the ability to switch among confd servers in case of network error
 * transparently for the consumer sufficiently strengthens the reading
 * reliability, and due to this, cluster robustness in whole.
 *
 * In the latter case the consumer initialises and starts m0_rconfc instance
 * instead of m0_confc, and performs all further reading via
 * m0_rconfc::rc_confc.
 *
 * Also, the consumer using rconfc doesn't provide any confd addresses
 * explicitly. The list of confd servers and other related information is
 * centralised and is maintained by HA service. Rconfc queries this information
 * on startup.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * @code
 * #include "conf/rconfc.h"
 * #include "conf/obj.h"
 *
 * struct m0_sm_group    *grp = ...;
 * struct m0_rpc_machine *rpcm = ...;
 * struct m0_rconfc       rconfc;
 *
 * void conf_exp_cb(struct m0_rconfc *rconfc)
 * {
 *         ...   clean up all local copies of configuration data    ...
 *         ... close all m0_conf_obj instances retained by consumer ...
 * }
 *
 * startup(const struct m0_fid *profile, ...)
 * {
 *         rc = m0_rconfc_init(&rconfc, grp, rpcm, conf_exp_cb);
 *         if (rc == 0) {
 *              rc = m0_rconfc_start_sync(&rconfc);
 *              if (rc != 0)
 *                      m0_rconfc_stop_sync(&rconfc);
 *         }
 *         ...
 * }
 *
 * ... Access configuration objects, using confc interfaces. ...
 *
 * reading(...)
 * {
 *        struct m0_conf_obj *obj;
 *        struct m0_confc    *confc = &rconfc.rc_confc;
 *        int                 rc;
 *        rc = m0_confc_open_sync(&obj, confc->cc_root, ... );
 *        ... read object data ...
 *        m0_confc_close(obj);
 * }
 *
 * shutdown(...)
 * {
 *         m0_rconfc_stop_sync(&rconfc);
 *         m0_rconfc_fini(&rconfc);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * For asynchronous rconfc start/stop please see details of
 * m0_rconfc_start_sync(), m0_rconfc_stop_sync() implementation or documentation
 * for m0_rconfc_start(), m0_rconfc_stop().
 *
 * @note Consumer is allowed to use any standard approach for opening
 * configuration and traversing directories in accordance with confc
 * specification. Using rconfc puts no additional limitation other than
 * stipulated by proper m0_rconfc_init().
