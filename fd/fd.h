 * @defgroup failure_domains Failure Domains
 * @{
 *
 * @section DLD-failure-domains-intro Overview
 *
 * A parity declustered layout divides a file into a collection of
 * parity groups. Each parity group has N number of data units, K number of
 * parity units, and S spare units, where S >= K. A parity declustered layout
 * de-clusters these parity groups across the available pool of hardware
 * resources, in such a way that:
 * - load per hardware resource is minimal in case of failure of any of the h/w
 *   resource.
 * - load across all h/w resources is as uniform as possible.
 *
 * A pool of h/w resources includes (but is not restricted to) racks,
 * enclosures, controllers, and disks. These resources form a
 * hierarchical structure that forms a tree. We call each of these resources a
 * failure-domain.
 *
 * @section DLD-failure-domains-def Definitions
 *
 * - Failure domain: Any h/w resource failure of which can cause a loss of a
 *   file data is called as a failure domain.
 * - Failure domain tree: A hierarchical topology in which failure domains are
 *   arranged is called a failure domain tree.
 * - Tolerance constraint: A vector of the size of height of failure domain
 *   tree, i^th member of which represents expected tolerable failures at
 *   that level of failure domain tree.
 * - Base tile: When parity groups from a tile are laid down sequentially over
 *   available pool of targets then we call such arrangement a base tile.
 * - Fault tolerant tile: A fault-tolerant permutation of base tile, that is
 *   applicable to all tiles across all files.
 *
 * @section DLD-failure-domains-highlights Design Highlights
 *
 * We aim to address two key issues:
 * - ensure that parity groups are declustered across the pool of resources
 *   such that user provided tolerance constraint is supported.
 * - data is distributed in such a way that load balancing is achieved during
 *   IO and repair of data.
 *
 * Failure domains algorithm achieves the first goal by creating a
 * fault tolerant tile, mapping of which will be common across all tiles
 * across all files. This tile is created only once, when pool version is
 * built. The second objective is attained by applying a sequence
 * of cascaded permutations to units from the fault tolerant tile, one at
 * each level of failure domains tree. These permutations are applied when IO or
 * SNS-repair require to map a parity group and unit, to target and frame
 * (and vice versa).

 *
 * @section DLD-failure-domains-req Requirements
 *
 * @b r.conf.pool.pool_version.fault_tolerant_permutation
 * Implementation must generate a fault tolerant permutation of base tile that
 * guarantees the required tolerance constraint for failure domains.
 *
 * @section DLD-failure-domains-dep Dependencies
 *
 * Pools in confc: Pools in confc are required in order to create a
