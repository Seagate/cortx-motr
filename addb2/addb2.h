/**
 * @defgroup addb2 ADDB.2
 *
 * Temporary note
 * --------------
 *
 * addb2 is a new implementation of addb sub-system. It has simpler external
 * interface, simpler and smaller implementation. For the time being, addb and
 * addb2 co-exist. Both versions send data over the network and store it
 * separately. Gradually, existing addb users will be converted to addb2. Once
 * the conversion is finished, addb implementation will be removed and addb2
 * renamed to addb throughout. Then, this note will also be removed.
 *
 * Overview
 * --------
 *
 * "ADDB" stands for "Analytic and Diagnostic Data-Base". Purpose of addb2
 * sub-system is to collect information about system behaviour for online and
 * offline analysis. For the purpose of addb2 design description, the following
 * components are identified:
 *
 *     * PRODUCER is a part of system that produces addb2 records to describe
 *       its behaviour. Motr sub-system becomes a PRODUCER after it is
 *       instrumented with addb2 calls. addb2 is itself a PRODUCER;
 *
 *     * CONSUMER is a part of system that is interested in learning about
 *       system behaviour through addb2. There are two classes of CONSUMERS:
 *
 *         - online (or synchronous) CONSUMER gets addb2 records as soon as they
 *           are produced,
 *
 *         - offline (or asynchronous) CONSUMER gets addb2 records possibly much
 *           later;
 *
 *     * IMPLEMENTATION is the addb2 sub-system itself (the code is in addb2/
 *       sub-directory). IMPLEMENTATION accepts records from PRODUCERS and
 *       delivers them to CONSUMERS;
 *
 *     * SYSTEM is a code outside of addb2, which configures addb2 and specifies
 *       how addb2 records flow across the network and where they are stored for
 *       offline consumption.
 *
 * All addb2 records have the same structure: a record (struct m0_addb2_record)
 * is a "measurement", tagged with a set of "labels". Measurements and labels
 * have the same structure, described by struct m0_addb2_value: a 56-bit
 * identifier, plus a time-stamp, plus a (variable up to 15, possibly 0) number
 * of 64-bit data items, called "payload". To give a fictitious, but realistic
 * example of a record:
 *
 * @verbatim
 *                |  IDENTIFIER      TIMESTAMP     PAYLOAD[0]    PAYLOAD[1] ...
 *    ------------+------------------------------------------------------------
 *    MEASUREMENT |  IO_WAIT_TIME     851263.911   5117216ns
 *    LABEL-6     |  DEVICE_FID       849265.721   7             200
 *    LABEL-5     |  FOP_OBJ_FID      842124.732   10            23213
 *    LABEL-4     |  CLIENT_ID        842124.732   404
 *    LABEL-3     |  FOP_OP_CODE      842124.732   COB_READ
 *    LABEL-2     |  SERVICE           15216.215   IOSERVICE
 *    LABEL-1     |  CPU_CORE            521.100   3
 *    LABEL-0     |  NODE_ID             100.321   20
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * Labels describe the context, in which the measurement occurred. In this case
 * the context is a read operation on a device with the fid (7, 200), which is
 * part of a read operation on a cob with fid (10, 23213), sent by a client 404
 * to the ioservice on the server 20 and handled on the 3rd core.
 *
 * The measurement itself is read operation latency: 5117216ns.
 *
 * Time-stamps (in nanoseconds) record the time when the measurement was taken
 * or the context was entered.
 *
 * Measurements can be produced in two ways:
 *
 *     - one-time measurements, like above, explicitly added by m0_addb2_add()
 *       call;
 *
 *     - continuous measurements, produced by "sensors" (m0_addb2_sensor).
 *       IMPLEMENTATION periodically reads the sensors associated with the
 *       context.
 *
 * Examples (sans time-stamps) of records produced by a sensor would be
 *
 * @verbatim
 *                |  IDENTIFIER      PAYLOAD[0]    PAYLOAD[1]    PAYLOAD[2]
 *    ------------+---------------------------------------------------------
 *    MEASUREMENT |  FREE_MEMORY     16GB
 *    LABEL-0     |  NODE_ID         20
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * and
 *
 * @verbatim
 *                |  IDENTIFIER      PAYLOAD[0]    PAYLOAD[1]    PAYLOAD[2]
 *    ------------+---------------------------------------------------------
 *    MEASUREMENT |  IO_SIZES        4KB           10MB          4MB
 *    LABEL-0     |  DEVICE_FID      7             200
 *    LABEL-1     |  NODE_ID         20
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * In the latter case, data items of IO_SIZES measurement are minimal (4KB),
 * maximal (10MB) and average (4MB) IO sizes for the given device.
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION is not interested in semantics of records. It is up to
 * PRODUCERS and CONSUMERS to agree on common values of identifiers and meaning
 * of payloads.
 *
 * PRODUCER interface
 * ------------------
 *
 * PRODUCER interface is used to submit addb2 records for consumption. An
 * important feature of this interface is a method used to compose contexts
 * (i.e., label sets) for records. This method must be
 *
 *     - flexible: contexts with variable number of labels with different
 *       payloads should be possible;
 *
 *     - modular: sub-systems should be able to contribute to the context
 *       without global coordination. For example, in the IO_WAIT_TIME example
 *       above, DEVICE_FID is added by the stob sub-system, which has no
 *       knowledge about ioservice.
 *
 * The interface is based on a notion of addb2 "machine" (m0_addb2_mach), which
 * is a locus, where context is incrementally built. A machine keeps track of
 * the current context, maintained as a stack. New label can be added to a
 * context by a call to m0_addb2_push() and the top-most label can be removed by
 * a call to m0_addb2_pop().
 *
 * A call to m0_addb2_add() adds a one-time measurement in the current context.
 *
 * A call to m0_addb2_sensor_add() adds sensor in the current context and
 * associates the sensor with the top label in the context. IMPLEMENTATION
 * periodically queries added sensors. A sensor is automatically de-activated
 * when the label the sensor is associated with is popped from the stack.
 *
 * An addb2 machine cannot, typically, be concurrently used, because concurrent
 * stack manipulations would make context meaningless.
 *
 * CONSUMER interface
 * ------------------
 *
 * CONSUMER interface is described in addb2/consumer.h
 *
 * SYSTEM interface
 * ----------------
 *
 * SYSTEM initialises addb2 machines, associates them with threads. It also
 * initialises network (see addb2/net.h) and storage (see addb2/storage.h)
 * components of IMPLEMENTATION.
 *
 * External entry-points of PRODUCER interface (m0_addb2_push(), m0_addb2_pop(),
 * m0_addb2_add(), m0_addb2_sensor_add(), etc.) all operate on the "current"
 * addb2 machine. IMPLEMENTATION assumes that the pointer to this machine is
 * stored in m0_thread_tls()->tls_addb2_mach (see addb2/addb2.c:mach()). If this
 * pointer is NULL, no operation is performed. It is up to SYSTEM to setup this
 * pointer in some or all threads.
 *
 * @note Currently, this pointer is set for all threads except for some
 * light-weight short-living threads like ones used to implement soft timers.
