 * @{
 *
 * CAS catalogue store provides an interface to operate with catalogues.
 * It's a thin layer that hides B-tree implementation details. Most of
 * operations are asynchronous. For usability CAS catalogue store provides
 * separate interfaces for operations over meta, catalogue-index and
 * catalogues created by user.
 * @note All operations over catalogue-index catalogue are synchronous.
 *
 * For now CAS catalogue store has two users: CAS service and DIX
 * repair/rebalance service.
 * @note CAS catalogue store is a singleton in scope of single process.
 * Every user of CAS catalogue store must call m0_ctg_store_init() to initialize
 * static inner structures if the user needs this store to operate. This call is
 * thread-safe. If catalogue store is already initialized then
 * m0_ctg_store_init() does nothing but incrementing inner reference counter.
 *
 * Every user of CAS catalogue store must call m0_ctg_store_fini() if it does
 * not need this store anymore. This call is thread-safe. When
 * m0_ctg_store_fini() is called the inner reference counter is atomically
 * decremented. If the last user of CAS catalogue store calls
 * m0_ctg_store_fini() then release of CAS catalogue store inner structures is
 * initiated.

 * The interface of CAS catalogue store is FOM-oriented. For operations that may
 * be done asynchronous the next phase of FOM should be provided. Corresponding
 * functions return the result that shows whether the FOM should wait or can
 * continue immediately.
 * Every user should take care about locking of CAS catalogues.
