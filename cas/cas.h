/**

 *
 * - @ref cas-fspec-ds

 *
 * @section cas-fspec-ds Data Structures
 * The interface of the service for a user is a format of request/reply FOPs.
 * Request FOPs:
 * - @ref m0_cas_op
 * Reply FOPs:
 * - @ref m0_cas_rep
 *
 * Also CAS service exports predefined FID for meta-index (m0_cas_meta_fid)
 * and FID type for other ordinary indexes (m0_cas_index_fid_type).
 *
 * @section cas-fspec-sub Subroutines
 * CAS service is a request handler service and provides several callbacks to
 * the request handler, see @ref m0_cas_service_type::rst_ops().
 *
 * Also CAS service registers several FOP types during initialisation:
 * - @ref cas_get_fopt
 * - @ref cas_put_fopt
 * - @ref cas_del_fopt
 * - @ref cas_cur_fopt
 * - @ref cas_rep_fopt
