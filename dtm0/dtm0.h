/**
 * @page dtm0s-fspec The dtm0 service (DTM0S)
 *
 * DTM0 will reuse existing cas service and cas fops/foms to deliver dtx related
 * information.
 *
 * Cas fop will aggregate additional data related to dtx, txr {list of
 * participants, versions, ...}. It creates a tx descriptor containing this
 * information and embeds it in cas_op as a dtm0 transaction payload.
 *
 * The interface of the service for a user is a format of request/reply FOPs.
 * DTM0 service registers following FOP types during initialisation:
 * - @ref dtm0_req_fop_fopt
 * - @ref dtm0_rep_fop_fopt
 *
 * DTM supports three kinds of FOP/FOM operations.
 * - EXECUTED FOP/FOM: when a cas fop is being executed, cas service will check
 *   for the existence of the dtm transaction information. If it is present, cas
 *   will log the tx descriptor locally on each of the dtm participants.  dtm0
 *   log will be updated inside cas fom (ad property of tx). The txr will be
 *   executed just before tx_close phase of the fom inside fom_fol_rec_add().
 * - REDO FOP/FOM: When a participant service restarts after a transient failure
 *   the other existing participants sends REDO requests to the recovering
 *   participant.
 * - PERSISTENT FOP/FOM: When the transaction get logged, DTM sends a PERSISTENT
 *   FOP to the other participants and to the originator indicating that the
 *   change caused by the Cas operation has become permanent.

 * Each dtm0_req_fop also carries a dtm_msg type which tells what kind of message it
 * is carrying.  A dtms0_op containing a request must specify a message type of
 * either DMT_EXECUTE,indicating that this request contains an operation to
 * be executed, a m0_dtms0_op containing a reply operation should contain either
 * a DMT_EXECUTED or a DMT_PERSISTENT message.
