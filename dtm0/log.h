/*
 * DTM0 log overview
 * -----------------
 *
 *   DTM0 log is a persistent or volatile storage for log records.
 * Functionally, log provides a way to add records and receive notifications
 * about their persistence. Logically, DTM0 log is formed as a threaded
 * B tree on the server side or as a threaded hashtable on the client side
 * (TODO). Each "thread" of such a structure forms a list. Server-side log
 * has N+K "threads" (lists). One list for originator/pruner, and N+K-1 lists
 * for the remote participants of a dtx.
 *   DTM0 log inputs are REDO messages and P (PERSISTENT) messages. When
 * a REDO message is inserted into the tree/htable, it is also gets linked
 * to the originator's list and to each remote participant's list. When
 * a P message is received, then the log entry gets removed from the
 * corresponding participant's list. Once the record becomes STABLE,
 * it is removed from the originator's list and inserted into the log
 * pruner list (re-using the link).
 *   DTM0 log has no FOMs. It reacts to the incoming events re-using
 * their sm groups. The log has one single lock that protects container
 * from modification. Individual log records has no lock protection.
 *
 * @section m0_dtm0_remach interface
 *
 * - m0_dtm0_log_iter_init() - initializes log record iterator for a
 *   sdev participant. It iterates over all records that were in the log during
 *   last local process restart or during last remote process restart for the
 *   process that handles that sdev.
 * - m0_dtm0_log_iter_next() - gives next log record for the sdev participant.
 * - m0_dtm0_log_iter_fini() - finalises the iterator. It MUST be done for every
 *   call of m0_dtm0_log_iter_init().
 * - m0_dtm0_log_participant_restarted() - notifies the log that the participant
 *   has restarted. All iterators for the participant MUST be finalized at the
 *   time of the call. Any record that doesn't have P from the participant at
 *   the time of the call will be returned during the next iteration for the
 *   participant.
 *
 * @section pmach interface
 *
 * - m0_dtm0_log_p_get_local() - returns the next P message that becomes local.
 *   Returns M0_FID0 during m0_dtm0_log_stop() call. After M0_FID0 is returned
 *   new calls to the log MUST NOT be made.
 * - m0_dtm0_log_p_put() - records that P message was received for the sdev
 *   participant.
 *
 * @section pruner interface
 *
 * - m0_dtm0_log_p_get_none_left() - returns dtx0 id for the dtx which has all
 *   participants (except originator) reported P for the dtx0. Also returns all
 *   dtx0 which were cancelled.
 * - m0_dtm0_log_prune() - remove the REDO message about dtx0 from the log
 *
 * dtx0 interface, client & server
 *
 * - m0_dtm0_log_redo_add() - adds a REDO message and, optionally, P message, to
 *   the log.
 *
 * @section dtx0 interface, client only
 *
 * - m0_dtm0_log_redo_p_wait() - returns the number of P messages for the dtx
 *   and waits until either the number increases or m0_dtm0_log_redo_cancel() is
 *   called.
 * - m0_dtm0_log_redo_cancel() - notification that the client doesn't need the
 *   dtx anymore. Before the function returns the op
 * - m0_dtm0_log_redo_end() - notifies dtx0 that the operation dtx0 is a part of
 *   is complete. This function MUST be called for every m0_dtm0_log_redo_add().
