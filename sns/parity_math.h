 *    encoding.
 *  @section incremental_recovery-discussion Discussion
 *  After encountering a failure, SNS client initializes the incremental
 *  recovery module by calling m0_sns_ir_init(). Followed by that it reports
 *  failed blocks with m0_sns_ir_failure_register().
 *  Once all failed blocks are registered, a call to m0_sns_ir_mat_compute()
 *  is placed. During this initialization the recovery module constructs
 *  a recovery matrix associated with failed blocks.
 *
 *  Once initialization is over, client passes available blocks to recovery
 *  module using the function m0_sns_ir_recover(). This function uses the fact
 *  that a lost block can be represented as a linear combination of alive
 *  blocks.  It keeps accumulating data from input alive blocks, as SNS client
 *  passes it.  Various parameters to m0_sns_ir_recover() tell the recovery
 *  routine how to use an incoming alive block for recovery. We will see how
 *  m0_sns_ir_recover() works using a simple example. Suppose we have four
 *  blocks in a parity group, b0 to b3, of which two have failed
 *  (say b0 and b1). Assume that these blocks satisfy following equations:
 *
 *  @code
 *    b0 = u0.b2 + u1.b3
 *    b1 = u2.b2 + u3.b3
 *  @endcode
 *  Note that each u_{i} is a  constant coefficient, which gets computed during
 *  m0_sns_ir_compute_mat(). When block b2 becomes available to SNS client, it
 *  submits it using m0_sns_ir_recover(). This routine then updates in-memory
 *  copies of b0 and b1 as below:
 *  @code
 *    b0 = u0.b2
 *    b1 = u2.b2
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Next, when block b3 gets submitted, m0_sns_ir_recover() adds its
 *  contribution cumulatively.
 *
 *  @code
 *  b0 += u1.b3
 *  b1 += u3.b3
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  We call this mode of recovery as incremental recovery, where failed blocks
 *  get recovered incrementally for each input alive block.
 *  In all, there are three use-cases as below
 *	 -# All failed blocks are data blocks.
 *	 -# All failed blocks are parity blocks.
 *	 -# Failed blocks are mixture of data and parity blocks.
 *
 *  It is worth noting that recovery of a lost parity block requires all data
 *  blocks. Hence in the third case above, we first require to recover all lost
 *  data blocks and then use recovered data blocks for restoring lost parity
 *  blocks. SNS client being unaware of dependencies between lost and
 *  available blocks, submits all available blocks to recovery module. When
 *  contribution by all available blocks is received at a destination node for
 *  a lost block, then SNS client marks recovery of that lost block as
 *  complete.
 *
 *  This algorithm works in three phases listed below:
 *  -# Phase1: transform alive blocks present locally on each node.
 *  -# Phase2: transform partially recovered data-blocks (from phase1 above)
 *             for failed parity-blocks.
 *  -# Phase3: add partially recovered blocks from last two phases at
 *             nodes where respective spare resides.
 *  In the first phase each node updates in-memory buffers for lost-blocks
 *  using in-memory buffers for alive blocks, local to the node. If the set of
 *  lost blocks consists of both data as well as parity blocks, then in the
 *  second phase, contribution of the partially recovered data blocks towards
 *  lost parity blocks gets computed. SNS client achieves this by calling
 *  m0_sns_ir_local_xform(). At this stage, if we add in-memory buffers of a
 *  lost block residing over all the nodes, then we would get a recovered
 *  block. In order to achieve this, each node sends an in-memory buffer of a
 *  lost block, to a node at which the spare for that block resides. Node at
 *  the receiving end then passes incoming blocks to m0_sns_ir_recover().
 *  This completes the third phase. Nodes that do not have any spare block,
 *  do not have any computations in the last phase. Next section illustrates
 *  entire recovery process using an example.
 *
 *  @section incremental_recovery-use-case Use-case
 *  Consider a case of six data blocks, two parity blocks, and two spare
 *  blocks, distributed over four nodes. Assume following mapping between
 *  data/parity/spare blocks and nodes. di represents the i^th data block,
 *  pi represents the i^th parity block, si represents i^th spare block,
 *  and Ni represents the i^th node.

 * Assume that blocks d2 and p1 are lost. Let us assume that d2 gets restored
 * at s0 and that of p1 gets restored at s1. Assume that d2 and p1 obey
 * following equations:
 * @code
 * d2 = (w0.d0 + w5.p0)           + (w1.d1 + w2.d3 + w4.d5) + (w3.d4)
 * p1 = (v0.d0)         + (v2.d2) + (v1.d1 + v3.d3 + v5.d5) + (v4.d4)
 * @endcode
 * In the equations above, vi and wi are constants, for each i. Note
 * that we have clubbed those terms which can be evaluated at a same node.
 * As discussed earlier, recovery of failed blocks is carried out in three
 * phases. Following table illustrates all three phases in the context of our
 * example. In the following table, we represent an in-memory buffer of a lost
 * block di, on node Nj as di_Nj.

 * We will now see how incremental-recovery APIs enable execution of various
 * phases described above.
 * Following code will show sequence of APIs that are executed at the node N0.

 * @code
 * struct m0_sns_ir	 ir;
 * struct m0_parity_math math;
 * :
 * :
 * ret = m0_sns_ir_init(&math, &ir);

 * // Construct recovery matrix for lost blocks.
 * ret = m0_sns_ir_mat_compute(&ir);
 * if (ret != 0)
 *	goto handle_error;
 * @endcode
 *
 * Once initialization is over, nodes start the compute phases described
 * earlier. Following code illustrates this for the node N0.
 * @code
 * // Phase 1
 * // Incrementally recovering d2 and p1 using d0.
 * m0_bitmap_set(bitmap, index_of(d0), true);
 * m0_sns_ir_recover(&ir, d0_N0, bitmap_d0, do_not_care);
 * // SNS client updates bitmaps associated with accumulator buffers for d2 and
 * // p1.
 * m0_bitmap_set(bitmap_d2, index_of(d0), true);
 * m0_bitmap_set(bitmap_p1, index_of(d0), true);
 * //Unset a bit from the bitmap that represents d0.
 * m0_bitmap_set(bitmap, index_of(d0), false);
 * // Incrementally recovering d2 and p1 using p0.
 * m0_bitmap_set(bitmap, index_of(p0), true);
 * m0_sns_ir_recover(&ir, p0_N0, bitmap_p0, do_not_care);
 * // SNS client updates bitmap associated with accumulator buffers for d2 and
 * // p1.
 * m0_bitmap_set(bitmap_d2, index_of(p0), true);
 * m0_bitmap_set(bitmap_p1, index_of(p0), true);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Once SNS client runs out of local blocks at N0, Phase 1 gets over. Second
 * phase gets executed using m0_sns_ir_local_xform(), as shown below:
 * @code
 * //Phase 2
 * m0_sns_ir_local_xform(&ir);
 * @endcode
 * Note that whenever a set of failed blocks does not contain both data and
 * parity blocks, the only operation m0_sns_ir_local_xform() performs is
 * changing the phase associated with recovery routine from M0_SI_BARE to
 * M0_SI_XFORM.
 * In the last phase, a node sends an in-memory buffer for a lost block to a
 * node where respective spare unit resides. Receiving node passes incoming
 * buffers to recovery routine.
 *
 * @code
 * //Phase 3 at N0
 * send_block_to_spare(p1_N0, N3);
 *
 * for (i = 2; i < 4; ++i) {
 *	m0_sns_ir_recover(&ir, d2_Ni, bitmap_d2_Ni, index_of(d0));
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * With every buffer that SNS client submits to m0_sns_ir_recover(), a bitmap
 * is submitted. Based upon indices of bits set in the bitmap, recovery module
 * figures out the members from a parity group that have contributed to the
 * incoming buffer. Hence, when a local block d0 gets submitted at node N0, a
 * bitmap accompanying has only that bit set which represents d0. On the
 * other hand, during third phase, a bitmap that accompanies d2_Ni has those
 * bits set which represent blocks local to node Ni.
 * When recovery gets over, node places a call to m0_sns_ir_fini().
 * @code
 * m0_sns_ir_fini(&ir);
