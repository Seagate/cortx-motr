 * Layout access plan, theory of operation
 * =======================================
 *
 * Overview
 * --------
 *
 * Layout access plan is an abstraction, which describes how a particular
 * operation is to be executed on an object or index.
 *
 * An access plan can be thought of as a directed graph, where vertices are
 * "plan operations" (plops) and arcs correspond to dependencies between plops.
 *
 * Take a network parity de-clustered layout as an example. To read an extent
 * from an object with this layout, one has to read data from the cobs of the
 * object. The plan for the object read would, therefore, contain a plop for
 * each cob read operation, each having an outgoing arc to the "operation
 * complete" plop.
 *
 * In case of a write to an object with parity de-clustered layout, the plan
 * contains additional plops corresponding to parity calculations. In case of
 * partial group write, the plan, in addition, contains read-plops describing
 * the logic of read-modify-write cycle. Degraded mode introduces more plops and
 * so on.
 *
 * Access plans are an intermediate abstraction designed for two main users:
 *
 *   - IO code in client API, including key-value indices and data objects, and
 *   - in-storage compute (ISC, aka Function Shipping).
 *
 * See also a quick introduction presentation at doc/PDF/layout-access-plan.pdf.
 *
 * Interface
 * ---------
 *
 * In the following, "implementation" means generic layout code and particular
 * layout type code, while "user" denotes a caller of the layout plan interface
 * (e.g., IO code).
 *
 * An access plan is represented by m0_layout_plan.
 *
 * The directed graph is not presented as a static data structure. Instead,
 * a plan produces, via calls to m0_layout_plan_get(), plops as they become
 * "ready", in the sense that all their dependencies are satisfied.
 *
 * Interaction between the implementation and the user takes form of the loop
 * (which is, basically, a graph traversal):
 *
 *   - the user calls m0_layout_plan_get() to obtain a ready plop. The
 *     implementation returns a plop, represented by a "sub-class" of
 *     m0_layout_plop. Some plop fields are set up by the implementation
 *     before the plop is handed to the user;
 *
 *   - the user processes the plop in the appropriate manner, e.g., executes
 *     read or write operation (which, in turn, might involve layout plans)
 *     and sets plop fields accordingly to the results of the execution (e.g.,
 *     points plop to the data read from a cob);
 *
 *   - the user calls m0_layout_plop_done() to signal the implementation that
 *     the plop has been executed. This might make more plops ready, so the
 *     loop repeats.
 *
 * All plops should be executed and m0_layout_plop_done() on them should be
 * called by the user in the dependency order indicated by the
 * m0_layout_plop::pl_deps list. Before starting the plop execution user should
 * call m0_layout_plop_start() which verifies whether the dependencies are
 * met and the plop is still actual (i.e. that it was not cancelled).
 *
 * A plop is not necessarily immediately destroyed by the implementation after
 * the user completes it. The implementation might keep plop alive for some
 * time, for example, data read from a cob might be needed for a future parity
 * calculation. When the implementation is done with the plop, it invokes
 * m0_layout_plop_ops::po_fini() call-back that the user might optionally set
 * before calling m0_layout_plop_done(). Between the call to
 * m0_layout_plop_done() and invocation of ->po_fini() call-back the plop (and
 * the user data buffers referenced by the plop fields) are shared between the
 * user and the application and the user should neither modify nor free the plop
 * or its data buffers.
 *
 * As an optimisation, implementation deterministically colours plops, in such a
 * way that a user can improve locality of reference by assigning colours to
 * processor cores. Colouring is optional and does not affect correctness.
 *
 * Use cases
 * ---------
 *
 * Let's consider, for example, the i/o read operation. The user calls
 * m0_layout_plan_build() passing m0_op as argument describing the operation.
 * After this we can enter the "loop" traversing the graph. m0_layout_plan_get()
 * is called and returns M0_LAT_READ plop. In this plop user gets cob fid
 * (at m0_layout_plop::pl_ent) and m0_layout_io_plop::iop_ext indexvec
 * describing where the unit to be read is located at the cob. Now, having this
 * information the user is ready to send the io fop to the ioservice.
 *
 * \image html layout-plan-simple-read.svg "Simple read graph"
 *
 * The next m0_layout_plan_get() call might return M0_LAT_OUT_READ indicating
 * the object data is ready for the user. But the data will be actually ready
 * only after the M0_LAT_READ plop on which M0_LAT_OUT_READ depends on is done.
 *
 * On receiving the reply from ioservice, the user puts the received io data
 * at m0_layout_io_plop::iop_data bufvec and calls m0_layout_plop_done(). Now
 * the user can access the data using M0_LAT_OUT_READ plop and call plop_done()
 * on it. One iteration of the graph traversing loop is done.
 *
 * Now, if the object is small and the bufvec at m0_op operation specified
 * by user spans only a single unit, the next call to m0_layout_plan_get()
 * might return M0_LAT_DONE indicating that the plan is done. But usually
 * objects consist of many units and a single m0_op might span many units
 * which, preferrably, should be read from the ioservice(s) in parallel. So
 * the user might call m0_layout_plan_get() many times and get a number of
 * M0_LAT_READ plops before calling the first m0_layout_plop_done().
 *
 * Let's look at the calls flow example below where u0, u1, u2 are the units
 * for which the plops are returned by the plan:
 *
 * @verbatim
    m0_layout_plan_build() ->
      u0: m0_layout_plan_get() -> M0_LAT_READ -> user may start reading...
      u1: m0_layout_plan_get() -> M0_LAT_READ -> in parallel...
      u2: m0_layout_plan_get() -> M0_LAT_READ -> ...
      ...
      u0: m0_layout_plan_get() -> M0_LAT_OUT_READ  -> wait for M0_LAT_READ...
      u0: the data for M0_LAT_READ is ready        -> m0_layout_plop_done()
      u0: now the data in M0_LAT_OUT_READ is ready -> m0_layout_plop_done()
      ...
      m0_layout_plan_get() -> M0_LAT_FUN -> user must check pl_deps:
          if all plops in the list are M0_LPS_DONE -> call the function and
                                                   -> m0_layout_plop_done()
      ...
      m0_layout_plan_get() -> +1 -> there are no more plops do to yet,
                                    user should complete some previous plops.
      ...
      m0_layout_plan_get() -> M0_LAT_DONE -> ... -> m0_layout_plop_done()
    m0_layout_plan_fini()
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * @note M0_LAT_OUT_READ plop can be returned by the plan for the unit even
 * before m0_layout_plop_done() is called for its M0_LAT_READ plop. It is
 * user responsibility to track the dependencies between plops (via pl_deps),
 * execute and call m0_layout_plop_done() on them in order.
 *
 * The picture becomes a bit more complicated when some disk is failed and
 * we are doing the degraded read. Or we are working in the read-verify mode.
 * In this case the plan would involve reading of the parity units also, as
 * well as running the parity calculation functions (M0_LAT_FUN plop) for
 * degraded groups or for every group (in read-verify mode). The function
 * would restore (or verify) data in a synchronous way.
 *
 * @note in case of the read-verify mode the verification status is indicated
 * by the return code from the m0_layout_fun_plop::fp_fun() call.
 *
 * The plan may change and adapt according to the situation. For example,
 * let's consider the case when some data unit in a parity group
 * cannot be read for some reason. The user should indicate the error to the
 * implementation via pl_rc at plop_done() for the M0_LAT_READ plop. The
 * implementation will change the plan and cancel all the plops that are no
 * longer relevant (like M0_LAT_OUT_READ for the failed M0_LAT_READ in this
 * case). On the next plan_get() calls the implementation will return
 * M0_LAT_READ plop(s) for the group parity unit(s), followed by M0_LAT_FUN
 * which would restore the failed data unit using the parity data, followed
 * by the new M0_LAT_OUT_READ plop for this data unit. Here is the diagram:
 *
 * \image html layout-plan-read-fail.svg "Read failure handling"
 *
 * ISC use case
 * ------------
 *
 * ISC user should analyse the plops and their dependencies in order to
 * figure out whether the user data can be obtained at the server side so
 * that the computation could be delegated there. In some cases, however,
 * the data may not be accessible at the server. For example, in degraded
 * mode some data units in some parity groups have to be recovered from
 * other data and parity units which may be located on different servers.
 * In this case the computation on the recovered units is better to do at
 * the client side.
 *
 * \image html layout-plan-isc-usage.svg "ISC usage example"
 *
 * If the graph dependency looks like a linear chain starting from M0_LAT_READ
 * and finishing with M0_LAT_OUT_READ, this might be a good canditate for ISC:
 *
 * @verbatim
      M0_LAT_READ <-- [ M0_LAT_FUN <-- ... ] <-- M0_LAT_OUT_READ
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * it means that the user data can be obtained at the server side
 * independently from the other servers (i.e. there are no several M0_LAT_READ
 * or parity calculation (M0_LAT_FUN) plops in the dependencies) and the
 * execution of such a chain of plops can be delegated to the server side
 * along with the ISC computation.
 *
 * ISC code should only make sure that the functions which may happen in
 * between the chain links can be run at the server side.
 *
 * In all other cases the user data should be retrieved at the client side
 * and the ISC computation on it should be done at the client side as well.
