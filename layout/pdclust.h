/**
 * @defgroup pdclust Parity de-clustering.
 *
 * Parity de-clustered layouts. See the link below for HLD and references to the
 * literature. Parity de-clustering generalises higher RAID patterns (N+K, with
 * K > 1) for the case where an object is striped over more target objects
 * ("devices" in the traditional RAID terminology) than there are units in a
 * parity group. Due to this, parity de-clustered layouts are parametrised by
 * three numbers:
 *
 * - N---number of data units in a parity group;
 *
 * - K---number of parity units in a parity group. Data in an object striped
 *   with a given K can survive a loss of up to K target objects. When a target
 *   object failure is repaired, distributed spare units are used to store
 *   re-constructed data. There are K spare units in each parity group, making
 *   the latter consisting of N+2*K units;
 *
 * - P---number of target objects over which layout stripes data, parity and
 *   spare units. A target object is divided into frames of unit size.
 *
 * Layout maps source units to target frames. This mapping is defined in terms
 * of "tiles" which are groups of frames. A tile can be seen either as an L*P
 * block of frames, L rows of P columns each, each row containing frames with
 * the same offset in every target object, or as a C*(N+2*K) block of C groups,
 * N+2*K frames each. Here L and C are two additional layout parameters selected
 * so that C*(N+2*K) == L*P.
 *
 * Looking at a tile as a C*(N+2*K) block, map C consecutive parity groups (each
 * containing N+2*K units) to it, then switch to L*P view and apply a certain
 * permutation (depending on tile number) to columns.
 *
 * HLD explains why resulting layout mapping function possesses a number of
 * desirable properties.
