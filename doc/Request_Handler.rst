Request Handler
================

Request handler is a central component of Motr code running on every node (client or server). Request handler takes a file operation packet (fop) and executes it by interacting with resource sub-system, authorization, and authentication mechanisms, and back-end stores.

Functional Description
**********************

A fop represents a file system or storage operation. It is typically created in a response to a system call made by a user level application running on a client. After some potential re-ordering (done by NRS) a fop is queued to a request handler. 

To process a fop, the request handler creates a state machine (fom) representing logic of the file system operation. The fom goes through a series of state transitions that involve updates to the data and meta-data, creation of other fops, sending messages to other nodes, waiting for messages, &c. Some of these state transitions are standard, in the sense that their implementation is generic for multiple fop types. Such standard state transitions (also called standard fom phases) include:

- authentication: verifying the capabilities with which some fop fields are signed;

- local resource acquisition: waiting until local resources (memory, cpu bandwidth and so on) are available. This phase allows control of the server load level and protects against thrashing;

- distributed resource acquisition: waiting until distributed resources (distributed locks, grants, quotas, &c.) are available. Request handler checks whether required resource usage rights are already granted to the local node. If not, resource requests are enqueued to the corresponding resource owners. This step involves creation of resource manager fops, their processing (again involving the request handler) and waiting until resource usage rights are granted. As a matter of policy, if some resources, either distributed or local, are not immediately available, fop execution can change its mode from wbc (write-back-cache), where fop is executed locally and its updates are cached, to intent mode, where fop is instead immediately sent to the target nodes, which own the resources. The target nodes continue the fop execution (again, selecting between wbc and intent modes). The decision to select execution mode depends on multiple factors:

  - local resource consumption on a node (intent node consumes less local resources); 

  - availability of distributed resources; 

  - contention on distributed resources: a server might instruct a client to not cache a particular piece of data or meta-data if this resource is contended by multiple clients;

- object checking and loading: request handler check the existence (or non-existence, as required) of local file system objects referenced by the fop and loads objects meta-data. For example, for a CREATE operation, the parent directory must exist and newly created child objectâ€”must not;

- authorization: at this phase, request handler checks that operations specified by the fop are authorized. This is done by (i) querying user data-base to translate user identifiers into internal form, (ii) fetching authorization data (acls) from the meta-data store and (iii) checking user identifiers against acls;

- local transaction context: updates to data and meta-data performed as part of the file system operation are executed in a context of local transaction. Transaction context is created by the request handler. This step might involve waiting until enough space is available in the log;

- execution of a fom might involve sending other fops out, for example, sending reply fops from the server back to the client. Request handler deals with the generic part of fop sending, including waiting for a space in the local fop cache.
