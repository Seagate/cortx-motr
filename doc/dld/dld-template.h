/**
   @page DLD-fspec DLD Functional Specification Template
   <i>Mandatory. This page describes the external interfaces of the
   component. The section has mandatory sub-divisions created using the Doxygen
   @@section command.  It is required that there be Table of Contents at the
   top of the page that illustrates the sectioning of the page.</i>

   - @ref DLD-fspec-ds
   - @ref DLD-fspec-sub
   - @ref DLD-fspec-cli
   - @ref DLD-fspec-usecases
   - @ref DLDDFS "Detailed Functional Specification" <!-- Note link -->

   The Functional Specification section of the DLD shall be placed in a
   separate Doxygen page, identified as a @@subpage of the main specification
   document through the table of contents in the main document page.  The
   purpose of this separation is to co-locate the Functional Specification in
   the same source file as the Detailed Functional Specification.

   A table of contents should be created for the major sections in this page,
   as illustrated above.  It should also contain references to other
   @b external Detailed Functional Specification sections, which even
   though may be present in the same source file, would not be visibly linked
   in the Doxygen output.

   @section DLD-fspec-ds Data Structures
   <i>Mandatory for programmatic interfaces.  Components with programming
   interfaces should provide an enumeration and @b brief description of the
   major externally visible data structures defined by this component.  No
   details of the data structure are required here, just the salient
   points.</i>

   For example:
<table border="0">
<tr><td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td>
   The @c dld_sample_ds1 structure tracks the density of the
   electro-magnetic field with the following:
@code
struct dld_sample_ds1 {
  ...
  int dsd_flux_density;
  ...
};
@endcode
   The value of this field is inversely proportional to the square of the
   number of lines of comments in the DLD.
</td></tr></table>
   Note the indentation above, accomplished by means of an HTML table
   is purely for visual effect in the Doxygen output of the style guide.
   A real DLD should not use such constructs.

   Simple lists can also suffice:
   - dld_sample_ds1
   - dld_bad_example

   The section could also describe what use it makes of data structures
   described elsewhere.

   Note that data structures are defined in the
   @ref DLDDFS "Detailed Functional Specification"
   so <b>do not duplicate the definitions</b>!
   Do not describe internal data structures here either - they can be described
   in the @ref DLD-lspec "Logical Specification" if necessary.

   @section DLD-fspec-sub Subroutines
   <i>Mandatory for programmatic interfaces.  Components with programming
   interfaces should provide an enumeration and brief description of the
   externally visible programming interfaces.</i>

   Externally visible interfaces should be enumerated and categorized by
   function.  <b>Do not provide details.</b> They will be fully documented in
   the @ref DLDDFS "Detailed Functional Specification".
   Do not describe internal interfaces - they can be described in the
   @ref DLD-lspec "Logical Specification" if necessary.

   @subsection DLD-fspec-sub-cons Constructors and Destructors

   @subsection DLD-fspec-sub-acc Accessors and Invariants

   @subsection DLD-fspec-sub-opi Operational Interfaces
   - dld_sample_sub1()

   @section DLD-fspec-cli Command Usage
   <i>Mandatory for command line programs.  Components that provide programs
   would provide a specification of the command line invocation arguments.  In
   addition, the format of any any structured file consumed or produced by the
   interface must be described in this section.</i>

   @section DLD-fspec-usecases Recipes
   <i>This section could briefly explain what sequence of interface calls or
   what program invocation flags are required to solve specific usage
   scenarios.  It would be very nice if these examples can be linked
   back to the HLD for the component.</i>

   Note the following references to the Detailed Functional Specification
   sections at the end of these Functional Specifications, created using the
   Doxygen @@see command:

/**
   @defgroup DLDDFS Motr Sample Module
   @brief Detailed functional specification template.

   This page is part of the DLD style template.  Detailed functional
   specifications go into a module described by the Doxygen @@defgroup command.
   Note that you cannot use a hyphen (-) in the tag of a @@defgroup.

   Module documentation may spread across multiple source files.  Make sure
   that the @@addtogroup Doxygen command is used in the other files to merge
   their documentation into the main group.  When doing so, it is important to
   ensure that the material flows logically when read through Doxygen.

   You are not constrained to have only one module in the design.  If multiple
   modules are present you may use multiple @@defgroup commands to create
   individual documentation pages for each such module, though it is good idea
   to use separate header files for the additional modules.  In particular, it
   is a good idea to separate the internal detailed documentation from the
   external documentation in this header file.  Please make sure that the DLD
   and the modules cross-reference each other, as shown below.

   @see The @ref DLD "Motr Sample DLD" its
   @ref DLD-fspec "Functional Specification"
   and its @ref DLD-lspec-thread

/**
   Subroutine1 opens a foo for access.

   Some particulars:
   - Proper grammar, punctuation and spelling is required
   in all documentation.
   This requirement is not relaxed in the detailed functional specification.
   - Function documentation should be in the 3rd person, singular, present
   tense, indicative mood, active voice.  For example, "creates",
   "initializes", "finds", etc.
   - Functional parameters should not trivialize the
   documentation by repeating what is already clear from the function
   prototype.  For example it would be wrong to say, <tt>"@param read_only
   A boolean parameter."</tt>.
   - The default return convention (0 for success and @c -errno
   on failure) should not be repeated.
   - The @@pre and @@post conditions are preferably expressed in code.

   @param param1 Parameter 1 must be locked before use.
   @param read_only This controls the modifiability of the foo object.
   Set to @c true to prevent modification.
   @retval return value
   @pre Pre-condition, preferably expressed in code.
   @post Post-condition, preferably expressed in code.
