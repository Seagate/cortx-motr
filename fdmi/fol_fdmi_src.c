/**
 * @addtogroup fdmi_fol_src
 *
 * <b>Implementation notes.</b>
 *
 * FDMI needs in-memory representaion of a FOL record to operate on.  So, FOL
 * source will increase backend transaction ref counter (fom->fo_tx.be_tx,
 * using m0_be_tx_get()) to make sure it is not destroyed, and pass
 * m0_fom::fo_tx as a handle to FDMI.  The refcounter will be decremented back
 * once FDMI has completed its processing and all plugins confirm they are
 * done with record.
 *
 * FDMI refc inc/dec will be kept as a separate counter inside m0_be_tx.  This
 * will help prevent/debug cases when FDMI decref calls count does not match
 * incref calls count.  At first, we used transaction lock to protect this
 * counter modification, but it caused deadlocks.  So we switched to using
 * m0_atomic64 instead.  This is OK, since inc/dec operations are never mixed,
 * they are always "in line": N inc operations, followed by N dec operations,
 * so there is no chance of race condition when it decreased to zero, and we
 * initiated tx release operation, and then "someone" decides to increase the
 * counter again.
 *
 * This is implementation of Phase1, which does not need transaction support
 * (that is, we don't need to re-send FDMI records, which would normally
 * happen in case when plugin for example crashes and re-requests FDMI records
 * starting from X in the past).  This assumption results in the following
 * implementation appoach.
 *
 * - We will keep transaction "open" until FDMI reports it has completed
 *   filter processing (m0_fdmi_src::fs_end()).  This
 *   simplifies a lot of stuff -- entire FOL record is available in memory for
 *   our manipulations (get_value and encode calls).
 * - We will NOT count incref/decref calls, and will completely release the
 *   record after m0_fdmi_src::fs_end() call.  (We will
 *   still implement the counter -- to put in a work-around for future
 *   expansion.)
 *
 * @section FDMI FOL records pruning on plugin side
 *
 * FDMI FOL records may be persisted on FDMI plugin side. In this case FDMI
 * plugin must handle duplicates (because the process with FDMI source may
 * restart before receiving "the message had been received" confirmation from
 * FDMI plugin). In case if the source of FDMI records is CAS there might also
 * be duplicates (FDMI FOL records about the same KV operation, but from
 * different CASes due to N-way replication of KV pairs in DIX), and they
 * must also be deduplicated.
 *
 * One of the deduplication approaches is to have some kind of persistence on
 * FDMI plugin side. Every record is looked up in this persistence and if there
 * is a match then it's a duplicate.
 *
 * The persistence couldn't grow indefinitely, so there should be a way to prune
 * it. One obvious thing would be to prune records after some timeout, but
 * delayed DTM recovery may make this timeout very high (days, weeks or more).
 * Another approach is to prune the records after it's known for sure that they
 * are not going to be resent again.
 *
 * Current implementation uses m0_fol_rec_header::rh_lsn to send lsn for each
 * FDMI FOL record to FDMI plugin. This lsn (log sequence number) is a
 * monotonically non-decreasing number that represents position of BE
 * transaction in BE log. FOL record is stored along with other BE tx data in BE
 * log and therefore has the same lsn as the corresponding BE tx. Several
 * transactions may have the same lsn in the current implementation, but there
 * is a limit on a number of transactions with the same lsn.
 * m0_fol_rec_header::rh_lsn_discarded is an lsn, for which every other
 * transaction with lsn less than rh_lsn_discarded is never going to be sent
 * again from the same BE domain (in the configurations that we are using
 * currently it's equivalent to the Motr process that uses this BE domain). It
 * means that every FDMI FOL record which has all rh_lsn less than corresponding
 * rh_lsn_discarded for its BE domain could be discarded from deduplication
 * persistence because there is nothing in the cluster that is going to send
 * FDMI FOL record about this operation.
 *
 * @section FDMI FOL records resend
 *
 * There are 2 major cases here:
 *
 * 1. FDMI plugin restarts, FDMI source is not. In this case FDMI source needs
 *    to resend everything FDMI plugin hasn't confirmed consumption for. This
 *    could be done by FDMI source dock fom by indefinitely resending FDMI
 *    records until either FDMI plugin confirms consumption or FDMI plugin
 *    process fails permanently.
 * 2. FDMI source restarts. The following description is about this case.
 *
 * FDMI source may restart unexpectedly (crash/restart) or it might restart
 * gracefully (graceful shutdown/startup). In either case there may be FDMI FOL
 * records that don't have consumption confirmation from FDMI plugin. Current
 * implementation takes BE tx reference until there is such confirmation from
 * FDMI plugin. BE tx reference taken means in this case that BE tx wouldn't be
 * discarded from BE log until the reference is put. BE recovery recovers all
 * transactions that were not discarded, which is very useful for FDMI FOL
 * record resend case: if all FOL records for such recovered transactions are
 * resent as FDMI FOL records then there will be no FDMI FOL record missing on
 * FDMI plugin side regardless whether FDMI source restarts or not, how and how
 * many times it restarts.
 *
 * It leads to an obvious solution: just send all FOL records as FDMI FOL
 * records during BE recovery.
 *
 * There are several ways this task could be done.
 *
 * @subsection Original FOM for each FOL record
 *
 * For each FOL record a fom with the orignal fom type is created. A special
 * flag is added to indicate that the fom was created during BE recovery . It
 * allows the fom to not to execute it's usual actions, but to close BE tx
 * immediatelly. Then, after BE tx goes to M0_BTS_LOGGED phase a generic fom
 * phase calls m0_fom_fdmi_record_post(), which sends FDMI record to FDMI plugin
 * as usual.
 *
 * @subsection Special FOM for each FOL record
 *
 * A special FOM would be created for each recovered BE tx. The purpose of the
 * fom would be post FDMI record with the FOL record for this BE tx and then
 * wait until consumption of the FDMI record is acklowledged.
 *
 * @subsection Post FDMI records for every BE tx
 *
 * FDMI FOL record for every recovered BE tx is posted as usual. FDMI source
 * dock fom would make a queue of all the records and it would send them and
 * wait for consumption acknowledgement as usual.
 *
 * @subsection A special BE recovery FOM phase
 *
 * A special FOM phase is added to every fom that stores something in BE. If the
 * fom is created during BE recovery, then initial phase of the fom is this
 * special phase. This allows each fom to handle BE recovery as it sees fit.
 * Default generic phase sequence should also include this special fom phase and
 * by default it would post FDMI FOL record in the same way it's done currently
 * for normal FOM phase sequence.
 *
 * @subsection Implementation details
 *
 * - Motr process should be able to send FDMI fops during BE recovery. BE
 *   recovery happens before DTM recovery, so at this stage only HA and Motr
 *   configuration should be brought up (along with their dependencies). It
 *   means that ioservice and DIX would be down at that time;
 * - FOL record shouldn't be discarded until it's consumed by FDMI plugin.
 *   Currently FOL record is in BE tx payload, so this requriement means that BE
 *   tx shouldn't be discarded from BE log before FDMI FOL record is consumed by
 *   FDMI plugin. It has several side effects:
 *   - current implementation recovers BE tx groups one by one, and the next
 *     group is recovered only after references to all transactions from the
 *     previous BE tx group are put. It means that FDMI plugin must consume all
 *     the records before the next BE tx group is recovered. Which doesn't sound
 *     complex on it's own, but there is a use case when it becomes critical:
 *   - if FDMI plugin needs to save FDMI record in a distributed index which is
 *     located on the same set of Motr processes as FDMI source, then we may
 *     have a deadlock even during usual cluster startup after non-clean
 *     shutdown: BE recovery would have some transactions on every participating
 *     server, so DIX wouldn't be operational. And FDMI plugin would require DIX
 *     to be at least somehow operational to consume FDMI records. This could be
 *     solved by allowing to have all BE tx groups to be recovered at the same
 *     time (which would require some rework in BE grouping and BE tx group
 *     fom), but even in this case we may get a deadlock if BE log is full. This
 *     could be solved by always having some part of BE log to be allocted to BE
 *     recovery activities, but with multiple subsequent failures during BE
 *     recovery even this part of the log may get full. It could be solved by
 *     preallocating space in BE segment to copy BE tx payloads from BE log to
 *     handle this particular case, but hey, we only want to resend FDMI records
 *     during BE recovery and record them to DIX in FDMI plugin and now we have
 *     to do several major changes to Motr components archivecture already.
