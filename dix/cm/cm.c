  @section DIXCMDLD-ovw Overview
  This module implements DIX copy machine using generic copy machine
  infrastructure. DIX copy machine is built upon the request handler service.
  The same DIX copy machine can be configured to perform multiple tasks,
  repair and rebalance using parity de-clustering layout.
  DIX copy machine is typically started during Motr process startup, although
  it can also be started later.

  @section DIXCMDLD-req Requirements
  - @b r.dix.cm.aggregation.group Aggregation groups should be implemented
    taking into account that it should lead to minimal changes into common
    framework.

  - @b r.dix.cm.data.next The implementation should efficiently select next
    data to be processed without causing any deadlock or bottle neck.

  - @b r.dix.cm.report.progress The implementation should efficiently report
    overall progress of data restructuring and update corresponding layout
    information for restructured objects.

  - @b r.dix.cm.repair.trigger For repair, DIX copy machine should respond to
    triggers caused by various kinds of failures.

  - @b r.dix.cm.repair.iter For repair, DIX copy machine iterator should iterate
    over parity group units on the survived component catalogues and accordingly
    write the lost data to spare units of the corresponding parity group.

  - @b r.dix.cm.rebalance.iter For rebalance, DIX copy machine iterator should
    iterate over the spare units of the repaired parity groups and copy the data
    from corresponding spare units to the target unit on the new device.

  - @b r.dix.cm.be.btree The implementation should work with BE btree directly
    without calling routines of CAS service.

  <hr>
  @section DIXCMDLD-depends Dependencies
  - @b r.dix.cm.resources.manage It must be possible to efficiently manage and
    throttle resources.

  @section DIXCMDLD-highlights Design Highlights
  - DIX copy machine uses request handler service infrastructure.
  - DIX copy machine specific data structure embeds generic copy machine and
    other DIX repair specific objects.
  - DIX copy machine defines its specific aggregation group data structure which
    embeds generic aggregation group.
  - Once initialised DIX copy machine remains idle until failure is reported.
  - DIX copy machine creates copy packets and allocates buffers dynamically
    without using of any pools.
  - Failure triggers DIX copy machine to start repair operation.
  - For multiple nodes, DIX copy machine maintains a local proxy of every other
    remote replica in the cluster.
  - For multiple nodes, DIX copy machine sets infinite bounds for its sliding
    window and communicates it to other replicas identified by the local proxies
    through READY FOPs.
  - Every node that serves some unit (from the same parity group) that contains
    data (as spare units can contain data as well) has enough information to
    restore parity by sending of served unit. To make this process more
    deterministic the following rule can be used: if some node serves unit with
    the lowest number (in scope of parity group) that contains data - this node
    is responsible for restoring of parity.
  - No data transformation is needed by DIX repair/re-balance processes.
  - Aggregation groups are not really needed by DIX repair/re-balance proccesses
    and can be implemented rudimentary. Such solution allows to use the code of
    generic copy machine without significant modification.
    @todo It would be nice to find the solution where implementation of any kind
    of aggregation groups is not necessary.
  - For rebalance, the same rule to determine responsible node for data
    reconstruction can be applied. DIX copy machine uses the same layout as
    used during DIX repair to map a unit to the target unit on new device.
    The newly added device may have a new UUID, but will have the same index in
    the pool and the component catalogues identifiers of the failed device and
    the replacement device will also be the same.

  @subsection DIXCMDLD-lspec-comps Component overview
  The focus of DIX copy machine is to efficiently restructure (repair or
  re-balance) data in case of failures, viz. device, node, etc. The
  restructuring operation is split into various copy packet phases.

  @subsection DIXCMDLD-lspec-cm-setup Copy machine setup
  DIX copy machine service allocates and initialises the corresponding copy
  machine.
  After cm_setup() is successfully called, the copy machine transitions to
  M0_CMS_IDLE state and waits until failure happens. As mentioned in the HLD,
  failure information is a broadcast to all the replicas in the cluster using
  TRIGGER FOP. The FOM corresponding to the TRIGGER FOP activates the DIX copy
  machine to start repair operation by invoking m0_cm_start(), this invokes DIX
  copy machine specific start routine which initialises specific data
  structures.

  Once the repair operation is complete the same copy machine is used to perform
  re-balance operation. In re-balance operation the data from the containing
  unit with the lowest index in the repaired parity group is copied to the new
  device using the layout.

  @subsection DIXCMDLD-lspec-cm-prepare Copy machine ready
  Once copy machine is initialised it is ready to start repair/re-balance
  process.

  @subsection DIXCMDLD-lspec-cm-start Copy machine startup
  Starts and initialises DIX copy machine data iterator.
  @see m0_dix_cm_iter_start()

  @subsection DIXCMDLD-lspec-cm-data-next Copy machine data iterator
  DIX copy machine implements an iterator to efficiently select next data to
  process. This is done by implementing the copy machine specific operation,
  m0_cm_ops::cmo_data_next(). The following pseudo code illustrates the DIX data
  iterator for repair as well as re-balance operation,

  @code
   - for each component catalogue C in ctidx
     - fetch layout L for C
     // proceed in local key order (keys belong to C).
     - for each local key I belonging to C
       // determine whether group S that I belongs to needs reconstruction.
       - if no device id is in the failure set continue to the next key
       // group has to be reconstructed, check whether the unit that contains
       // data and has the lowest number in group S is served locally
       - for each data, parity and spare unit U in S (0 <= U < N + 2K)
         - if U is local && U contains data && U number is min
           - determine destination
           - create copy packet
  @endcode
  The above iterator iterates through each component catalogue in
  catalogue-index catalogue in record key order and determines whether
  corresponding parity group needs reconstruction, if yes then checks whether it
  serves the unit that contains data and has the lowest index in scope of parity
  group, if so then this node is responsible for data reconstruction. After that
  the destination is determined and copy packet is created.

  @subsection DIXCMDLD-lspec-cm-sliding-window Copy machine sliding window
  DIX copy machine supports only infinite sliding window that does not
  need to be maintained.
  It is caused by the following reasons:
  - DIX repair/rebalance processes have no data transformation, so it is not
  needed to regulate data reconstruction process using sliding window
  - Aggregation groups IDs can not be determined and ordered for distributed
  indices to apply sliding window
  Some mandatory callbacks can be implemented as stubs.

  @subsection DIXCMDLD-lspec-cm-stop Copy machine stop
  Once all the component objects corresponding to the distibuted indices
  belonging to the failure set are re-structured (repair or re-balance) by every
  replica in the cluster successfully, the re-structuring operation is marked
  complete.

  @subsection DIXCMDLD-lspec-thread Threading and Concurrency Model
  DIX copy machine is implemented as a request handler service, thus it shares
  the request handler threading model and does not create its own threads. All
  the copy machine operations are performed in context of request handler
  threads.

  DIX copy machine uses generic copy machine infrastructure, which implements
  copy machine state machine using generic Motr state machine infrastructure.
  @ref State machine <!-- sm/sm.h -->

  Locking
  All the updates to members of copy machine are done with m0_cm_lock() held.

  <hr>
  @section DIXCMDLD-conformance Conformance
  - @b i.dix.cm.aggregation.group Aggregation groups should be implemented
    taking into account that it should lead to minimal changes into common
    framework.

  - @b i.dix.cm.data.next DIX copy machine implements a next function using
    catalogue-index catalogue iterator and pdclust layout infrastructure to
    select the next data to be repaired from the failure set. This is done in
    component catalogue fid order.

  - @b i.dix.cm.report.progress The implementation should efficiently report
    overall progress of data restructuring and update corresponding layout
    information for restructured objects.

  - @b i.dix.cm.repair.trigger Various failures are reported through TRIGGER
    FOP, which create corresponding FOMs. FOMs invoke dix specific copy machine
    operations through generic copy machine interfaces which cause copy machine
    state transitions.

  - @b i.dix.cm.repair.iter For repair, DIX copy machine iterator iterates over
    record keys, determines whether servived data containing unit with the
    lowest index in scope of parity group is served locally to use it for lost
    data reconstruction.

  - @b i.dix.cm.rebalance.iter For rebalance, DIX copy machine acts like the
    repair iterator to copy the data to the corresponding target units on the
    new device.

  - @b i.dix.cm.be.btree DIX copy machine calls BE btree interfaces without
    calling of routines of CAS service.
