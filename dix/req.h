 *
 * DIX requests allow to access and modify distributed indices. Requests are
 * executed in the context of distributed index client.
 *
 * Record operations logic
 * -----------------------
 * GET, PUT, DEL operations share a common logic:
 * - Retrieve index layout descriptor. There are 3 cases:
 *   * Layout descriptor is provided by user: nothing to do.
 *   * Layout id is provided by user: lookup descriptor in layout-descr index.
 *   * Only index fid is specified: lookup descriptor starting from root index.
 * - Create index layout instance (@ref m0_dix_linst) based on layout
 *   descriptor.
 * - Calculate numerical orders of storage devices in a pool (Dn, Dp1 ... Dpk,
 *   Ds1 ... Dsk) that are involved into operation using built layout instance.
 *   Devices Dn, Dp1 ... Dpk are used to store K+1 replicas of index
 *   records. Devices Ds1 .. Dsk only used in degraded mode (during index
 *   repair/rebalance). Numerical order of every pool device is stored in
 *   configuration (m0_conf_sdev::sd_dev_idx).
 * - For every device involved find CAS service serving it. This relationship is
 *   also stored in configuration database.
 * - For every element in input operation vector (record for put(), key for
 *   del(), etc.) execute corresponding CAS operation against:
 *     * Random CAS service if operation doesn't modify index (get).
 *     * All CAS services if operation carries modification (put, del).
 *   Operations are executed in parallel.
 * - Wait until all operations are finished and collect results.
 *
 * NEXT operation logic:
 * - Retrieve index layout descriptor as it's done for other record operations.
 * - For every storage device in a pool find CAS service serving it.
 * - Execute in parallel CAS requests of NEXT type for all component catalogues
 *   of the index (every pool storage device stores component catalogue).
 * - Wait replies from all CAS services and then merge-sort them by record keys.
 *   Leave only requested by user number of records, throwing away excess
 *   records.
 *
 * Execution context
 * -----------------
 * Client operations are executed in the context of state machine group
 * provided at initialisation. All DIX requests have asynchronous interface. It
 * is possible to run several requests in the context of one client
 * simultaneously even if the same state machine group is used.
 *
 * All DIX requests are asynchronous and user shall wait until request
 * reaches one of DIXREQ_FINAL, DIXREQ_FAILURE states.
