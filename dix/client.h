 *
 * Distributed index client provides an interface to access and modify
 * distributed indices. It uses CAS client internally and extends its
 * functionality by providing indices distribution.
 *
 * Please refer to HLD of the distributed indexing for high-level overview.
 *
 * Dependencies
 * ------------
 * - CAS client to make requests to CAS service.
 * - @ref m0_pools_common to locate RPC connections to CAS services in a pool,
 *   where distributed index is stored.
 * - Motr layout functionality to determine destination CAS services for CAS
 *   requests.
 * - Pool machine state for correct operation in degraded mode.
 *
 * Index meta-data
 * ---------------
 * There are three meta-indices that are used by client internally and can be
 * manipulated through appropriate interfaces externally:
 * - Root index. Top-level index to find all other indices. Its pool version
 *   is stored in cluster configuration as one of file system parameters (@ref
 *   m0_conf_root::rt_imeta_pver). Other layout parameters are
 *   hard-coded. Root index contains exactly two records for now with layouts of
 *   'layout' and 'layout-descr' meta-indices. Please note, that pool version
 *   for root index should contain only storage devices controlled by CAS
 *   services, no IOS storage devices are allowed.
 *
 * - Layout index. Holds layouts of "normal" indices. Layouts are stored in the
 *   form of index layout descriptor or index layout identifier.
 *
 * - Layout-descr index. Maps index layout identifiers to full-fledged
 *   index layout descriptors.
 *   User is responsible for index layout identifiers allocation and
 *   populates layout-descr index explicitly with m0_dix_ldescr_put().
 *   Similarly, m0_dix_ldescr_del() deletes mapping between layout identifier
 *   and layout descriptor.
 *
 * Meta-data is global for the file system and normally is created during
 * cluster provisioning via m0_dix_meta_create(). Meta-data can be destroyed via
 * m0_dix_meta_destroy(). Also user is able to check whether meta-data is
 * accessible and is correct via m0_dix_meta_check(). Distributed index
 * meta-data is mandatory and should always be present in the filesystem.
 *
 * Initialisation and start
 * ------------------------
 * Client is initialised with m0_dix_cli_init(). The main argument is a pool
 * version fid of the root index. All subsequent operations use this fid to
 * locate indices in the cluster.
 *
 * User should start the client in order to make DIX requests through the
 * client. Client start procedure is executed through m0_dix_cli_start() or
 * m0_dix_cli_start_sync(). The start procedure involves reading root index to
 * retrieve layouts of 'layout' and 'layout-descr' meta-indeces.
 *
 * There is a special client mode called "bootstrap" mode. In that mode the only
 * request allowed is creating meta-indices in cluster (m0_dix_meta_create()).
 * A client can be moved to this mode just after initialisation using
 * m0_dix_cli_bootstrap() call. It's useful at cluster provisioning state,
 * because client can't start successfully without meta-indices being created in
 * motr file system. After meta indices creation is done, client can be started
 * as usual or finalised.
 *
 * Operation in degraded mode
 * --------------------------
 * DIX client relies on HA notifications to detect device failures. In order to
 * receive HA notifications, the process where DIX client resides should be
 * added to the cluster configuration. On receiving device failure notification
 * local pool machines for all affected pool versions are updated accordingly.
 *
 * DIX client is said to perform an operation over distributed index in degraded
 * mode if at least one device in index pool version has failed or under
 * repair/re-balance. Note, that offline device (i.e. the one with
 * M0_PNDS_OFFLINE state) doesn't imply degraded mode. DIX client doesn't treat
 * offline devices in any special way and the user is likely to get an error
 * during record put/delete operation.
 *
 * DIX client uses component catalogues with spare units instead of component
 * catalogues stored on failed drives during operation in degraded mode. Below
 * is a table showing how DIX client treats target component catalogue for
 * different operations depending on the disk state storing this catalogue.
 *
 * Disk state    |  GET           PUT             DEL            NEXT
 * --------------|---------------------------------------------------
 * FAILED        | Skip        Use spare        Skip             Skip
 *               |
 * REPAIRING     | Skip        Use spare        Use spare        Skip
 *               |
 * REPAIRED      | Use spare   Use spare        Use spare        Skip
 *               |
 * REBALANCING   | Use spare   Use it + spare   Use it + spare   Skip
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * DIX client relies on the fact that device will transit from FAILED to
 * REPAIRING state, and it's not possible to transit from FAILED to ONLINE
 * state. Otherwise, replicas written to spares when the device was FAILED
 * won't be taken into account when disk returns to ONLINE state.
 *
 * NEXT operation always ignores non-online disks, because this operation
 * queries all online disks in a pool version and a layout guarantees that at
 * least one correct replica for every record is available.
 *
 * There is a possible race, where repair/re-balance service sends the old value
 * to the spares/re-balance targets concurrently with a DIX client update. In
 * order to avoid it DEL operation is executed in 2 phases. The process slightly
 * differs for repair and re-balance.
 *   - During repair DIX client updates correct replicas, gets reply, and after
 *     that updates spares. Getting reply for all correct replicas guarantees
 *     that repair service either already processed this record and the spares
 *     are updated or record is not processed at all and successfully deleted.
 *   - During re-balance DIX client updates correct replicas (including spares),
 *     gets reply, and after that updates re-balance target.
 *
 * Client sets special COF_DEL_LOCK flag in CAS request to make a hint to CAS
 * service that special global "delete" lock should be taken for catalogue store
 * prior to deletion. That lock guarantees that CAS service will do record
 * deletion when the record is either already repaired/re-balanced or
 * repair/re-balance process for this record is not started yet.
