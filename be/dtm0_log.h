/**
 * @page dtm0 log implementation
 *
 * @section Overview
 * DTM0 log module will be working on incoming message request, the goal of
 * this module is to track journaling of incoming message either on persistent
 * or volatile memory based on whether logging is happening on participant or
 * on originator, so that in the phase failure consistency of failed
 * participant can be restored by iterating over logged journal(DTM0 log
 * record) to decide which of the logged record needs to be sent as a redo
 * request.
 *
 * A distributed transaction(dtx) has a group of states of each individual
 * participant of the distributed transaction(dtx) (note: originator is not a
 * part of this group). Each entry of such a group may have many different
 * states, but this set of states must include the following states:
 *
 * 1) InProgress - the node (owner of the log) has a request.
 * 2) Executed - one or more operations have been executed in volatile
 *               memory of the participant, the result of such execution
 *               is known and returned to the dtx user.
 * 3) Persistent - locally persisted in transactional context.
 * 4) Stable - sufficient number of sent operations have been “persisted”
 *             on the remote end which guarantees survivial of persistent
 *             failures.
 * 5) DONE - all sent operations have been “persisted” on sufficient
 *           number of non-failed participants.
 *
 * Every participant maintains the journal record(DTM0 Log record) that
 * corresponds to each distributed transaction(dtx) and it can be described by
 * "struct m0_dtm0_log_rec" which will be stored in volatile/persistent
 * storage. Basically this log record will maintain txr id, group of state of
 * each individual participant and payload.
 *
 * When a distributed transaction(dtx) is executed by participant, participant
 * modifies its state in group of state as M0_DTPS_EXECUTED and will add/modify
 * DTM0 log record, for rest of the participant it will keep the state as it is
 * in distributed transaction(dtx).
 *
 * When a distributed transaction(dtx) becomes persistent on participant,
 * participant will modify its state in group of state as M0_DTPS_PERSISTENT
 * and will modify DTM0 log record. For rest of the participants it will keep
 * the state as it is in DTM0 log record.
 *
 * Originator also maintains the same distributed transaction(dtx) record in
 * volatile memory. Originator is expecting to get replies from participant
 * when distributed transaction(dtx) on participant is M0_DTPS_EXECUTED or
 * M0_DTPS_PERSISTENT. On originator the state of the distributed transaction
 * (dtx) can be M0_DTPS_INPROGRESS to M0_DTPS_PERSISTENT for each participant.
 *
 * During recovery operation of any of the participant, rest of the participant
 * and originator will iterate over the logged journal and extract the state
 * of each transation for participant under recovery from logged information
 * and will send redo request for those distributed transaction(dtx) which  are
 * not M0_DTPS_PERSISTENT on participant being recovered.
 *
 * Upon receiving redo request participant under recovery will log the state
 * of same distributed transaction(dtx) of remote participant in persistent
 * store.
 *
 * @section Usecases
 *
 * 1. There is a dedicated function m0_be_dtm0_log_create which will create
 *    m0_be_dtm0_log during mkfs procedure.
 *
 * 2. When a distributed transaction(dtx) is successfully executed on a participant,
 *    the participant will add a new log record to DTM0 log. The state of the
 *    participant will be set to M0_DTPS_EXECUTED in the record. The states of the
 *    other participants will be set to M0_DTPS_INPROGRESS in the record.
 *
 * 3. When a distributed transaction(dtx) becomes persistent on a particular
 *    participant, the state of the distributed transaction(dtx) for this
 *    participant will be updated to M0_DTPS_PERSISTENT.
 *
 * 4. When distributed transaction(dtx) becomes persistent on a participant,
 *    this participant sends a persistent notice to rest of the participants
 *    and to the originator indicating that the given distributed transaction(dtx)
 *    is now persistent on its store. Upon receiving a persistent notice, the
 *    recipient will update the state of the distributed transaction(dtx) for the
 *    sender as M0_DTPS_PERSISTENT in its own DTM0 log.
 *
 *    There is one special case where a participant gets a persistent notice from
 *    another participant but the corresponding request and reply haven't been
 *    received/processed yet. In this case, the DTM service should add a special
 *    log record: a log record with empty payload (NULL). The users of DTM0 log
 *    should be ready to encounter such a log entry, and handle it appropriately.
