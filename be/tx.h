/**
 * @defgroup be Meta-data back-end
 *
 * Transaction engine.
 *
 * Main abstractions provided by this module are:
 *
 *     - transaction m0_be_tx: is a group of updates to BE segment memory,
 *       atomic w.r.t. BE failures. A transaction can update memory within
 *       multiple segments in the same m0_be_domain. A BE user creates a
 *       transaction and then updates segment memory. After each update, the
 *       updated memory is "captured" in the transaction by calling
 *       m0_be_tx_capture();
 *
 *     - transaction credit m0_be_tx_credit: an object describing an update to
 *       segment memory that a transaction could make. Before a memory update
 *       can be captured in a transaction, the transaction should be "prepared"
 *       (m0_be_tx_prep()) for all forthcoming captures. This preparation
 *       reserves internal transaction resources (log space and memory) to avoid
 *       dead-locks;
 *
 *     - transaction engine m0_be_tx_engine: is a part of BE domain that
 *       contains all transaction related state.
 *
 * Overview of operation.
 *
 * When a memory region is captured in a transaction, the contents of this
 * region, i.e., new values placed in the memory by the user, are copied in a
 * transaction-private memory buffer. Eventually the transaction is closed,
 * i.e., the user indicates that no more updates will be captured in the
 * transaction. Closed transactions are collected in "transaction groups"
 * (m0_be_tx_group), which are units of IO. When a group is formed it is written
 * to the log. When log IO for the group completes, transactions from the group
 * are written "in-place", that is, their captured updates are written to the
 * corresponding places in the segment storage. Some time after a transaction is
 * written in-place, it is discarded and the space it uses in the log is
 * reclaimed.
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 *     - transaction engine implements redo-only WAL (write-ahead logging).
 *       There is no way to abort a transaction;
 *
 *     - serializibility and concurrency concerns are delegated to a user.
 *       Specifically, the user must call m0_be_tx_capture() while the lock,
 *       protecting the memory being captured is held. In the current
 *       implementation this lock must be held at least until the transaction
 *       is closed, in the future this requirement will be weakened;
 *
 *     - currently, the transaction engine writes modified memory in place,
 *       as described in the "Overview of operation" section. In the future,
 *       the transaction engine would leave this task to the (currently
 *       non-existing) segment page daemon;
 *
 *     - transaction close call (m0_be_tx_close()) does not guarantee
 *       transaction persistence. Transaction will become persistent later.
 *       The user can set a call-back m0_be_tx::t_persistent() that is called
 *       when the transaction becomes persistent;
 *
 *     - transactions become persistent in the same order as they close.
