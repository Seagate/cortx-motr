/**
 * BE uses write-ahead logging. Log is used as a place to write information
 * about transactions to make transactions recoverable.
 *
 * Logically, log is an infinite sequence of log records. Physical
 * representation is implemented by log_store.
 *
 * A position in the log is identified by a "log sequence number" (lsn), which
 * is simply an offset in the logical log. Lsn uniquely identifies a point in
 * system history.
 *
 * <b>Log record</b>
 *
 * Log record encapsulates multiple buffers and provides interface for access
 * to specific buffer. Log record is placed continuously in log (but not
 * necessarily in stob).
 *
 * Every buffer is read/written by separated log I/O and as result must be
 * aligned for stob I/O. This is guaranteed by log record implementation.
 *
 * A log record has log record header and footer. They are written as part of
 * the first and the last buffer respectively. Therefore they don't require
 * separated aligned buffers nor log I/Os. Additional memory for header and
 * footer is allocated transparently for user.
 *
 * Log record format:
 *
 * @verbatim
 * +--------+----------------------+-//-+-----------------------+--------+
 * | header | 1st buffer | padding |    | last buffer | padding | footer |
 * +--------+----------------------+-//-+-----------------------+--------+
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * A valid log record is record that fully resides on backing store and is not
 * corrupted.
 *
 * Log record structure can be reused after reset.
 *
 * <b>Reservation</b>
 *
 * User must reserve space in log for every record before operations with the
 * record. Reserved space can be larger than will be actually used, but can't be
 * less. Reservation doesn't allocate space inside log and doesn't make I/O.
 *
 * User must use function m0_be_log_reserved_size() with maximum possible
 * buffers. This function returns required space in log for respective log
 * record and takes into account header, footer and paddings.
 *
 * If m0_be_log_reserve() returns -EAGAIN user should repeat attempt later.
 * Proper condition for this is call of user-defined callback function. This
 * callback function is passed to log as field lc_got_space_cb in configuration.
 *
 * Reservation mechanism guarantees that infinite log can be implemented with
 * finite backing store.
 *
 * <b>Log header</b>
 *
 * Log header contains information required for restoring current position in
 * log after successful closing of the log. If log isn't closed successfully
 * recovery is responsible for setting correct log's pointers after
 * initialisation.
 *
 * Fields of log header:
 *   - Pointer to a valid log record. On successful close this field contains
 *     pointer to the last record.
 *   - Size of the valid log record.
 *
 * When the valid log record from log header needs to be rewritten on backing
 * store the log header must be updated before the record becomes corrupted.
 * It guarantees that log header always points to a valid log record.
 *
 * Also header is updated on close of log. It is done for two reasons:
 *   - Store pointer to the last record and continue writing new records from
 *     this point.
 *   - Keep pointer closer to the last record to reduce number of reads during
 *     recovery.
 *
 * Log uses log_store's redundant buffer to store log header. Log header is self
 * recoverable and m0_be_log_header_read() returns correct header even if it is
 * partially written. As result this function can make I/O.
 *
 * <b>Discarding</b>
 *
 * When user doesn't need log record it should be discarded. Discarding notifies
 * that log record structure isn't accessed and log record in log isn't
 * required. User must not discard a log record before I/O to log is finished.
 *
 * Discarded log record is counted as free space only when all previous log
 * records (with smaller lsn) are discarded too.
 *
 * If a record wasn't discarded before shutdown it should be discarded after
 * reading and re-applying during recovery. User must not discard log record if
 * it is read not for re-applying.
 *
 * <b>Finalisation of non-discarded log records</b>
 *
 * Log allows finalisation of non-discarded log records, but counts them as not
 * placed ones. If such a record exists log sets boolean lg_unplaced_exists to
 * true and all space after the first unplaced record is counted used. This mode
 * is cleared only after closing of the log and must not be used during normal
 * work.
 *
 * This mode can be used during shutdown when user can't complete operations but
 * wants recovery to re-apply them.
 *
 * Recovery is responsible for re-applying all unplaced and following them log
 * records.
 *
 * <b>Log record iterator</b>
 *
 * Log record iterator is a structure that contains only information from log
 * record header and provides interface initial/next/prev for scanning log. This
 * approach allows to keep information about all log records in memory and read
 * the content on-demand.
 *
 * <b>Locking</b>
 *
 * User is responsible for locking of log's fields. This external lock is passed
 * to log through configuration and is used only in preconditions.
 *
 * Log record's field lgr_state is protected by lg_record_state_lock. It needs
 * to be protected only after the record is scheduled.
 *
 * <b>Guarantees</b>
 *
 * User must guarantee:
 *   - Eliminate access to log record after it is scheduled and before log
 *     signals about its completion;
 *   - Recover I/O errors before attempt to write to the log. Log must not
 *     contain corrupted log record among valid ones;
 *
 * Log guarantees:
 *   - Log record is not accessed by log after user is signalled about
 *     completion of operation with record;
 *   - A valid log record which is pointed by log header and following records
 *     are not rewritten or updated.
 *
 * <b>Usecases</b>
 *
 * Write to log:
 *   1. m0_be_log_record_init
 *   2. m0_be_log_record_io_create for every buffer
 *   3. m0_be_log_record_allocate
 *   4. m0_be_log_reserve
 *   5. m0_be_log_record_io_size_set for every buffer
 *   6. m0_be_log_record_io_prepare
 *   7. Fill every buffer with data
 *   8. m0_be_log_record_io_launch
 *   9. m0_be_log_record_discard
 *   10. If log record is reusable then m0_be_log_record_reset and jump to 4.
 *   11. m0_be_log_record_deallocate
 *   12. m0_be_log_record_fini
 *
 * Read from log:
 *   1. m0_be_log_record_iter_init
 *   2. m0_be_log_record_initial/next/prev
 *   3. m0_be_log_record_init
 *   4. m0_be_log_record_io_create for every buffer
 *   5. m0_be_log_record_allocate
 *   6. m0_be_log_record_assign
 *   7. m0_be_log_record_io_prepare
 *   8. m0_be_log_record_io_launch
 *   9. Access to buffers
 *   9. If recovery re-applies record then m0_be_log_record_discard
 *   10. If log record is reusable then m0_be_log_record_reset and jump to 6.
 *   11. m0_be_log_record_deallocate
 *   12. m0_be_log_record_fini
 *
 * @todo BE log's positions grow to infinity, but have uint64_t type.
 *       Better solution will be usage of blocks instead of bytes for the
 *       positions.
