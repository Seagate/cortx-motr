 * @section seg0-metadata Meta-segment (seg0), systematic BE storage startup.
 * <b>Overview.</b>
 *
 * Seg0 stores an information to bring all BE subsystems up. It may include
 * different hierarchies of objects which have to be brought up and initialized
 * systematically. So the goal of metadata is to store an information which is
 * used to specify an order and some options for BE subsystem initialization
 * and startup.
 *
 * It's supposed that BE objects like segment or different structures stored
 * inside it, have no mutual dependencies, so the initialization order and
 * metadata may have trivial format.
 *
 * It's assumed that different BE objects of the same type can be brought up
 * independently. This assumption makes initialization routines straightforward.
 *
 * Concrete BE-object initialization depends on a tier of BE-objects which have
 * to be started before it. Type of this object has to be registered after types
 * from which initialization of this object depends on.
 *
 * The example hierarchiy below has the following startup ordering:
 * M0_BE:SEG, M0_BE:COB, M0_BE:MDS, M0_BE:AD, M0_BE:BALLOC.
 *
 * @dot
 *  digraph conf_fetch_phase {
 *      node [fontsize=9];
 *      edge [fontsize=9];

 *      "M0_BE:SEG1"    [shape=rect, style=filled, fillcolor=lightgrey];

 *      "M0_BE:SEG0" -> "M0_BE:SEG2"
 *      "M0_BE:SEG0" -> "M0_BE:SEGN"
 *      "M0_BE:SEG1" -> "M0_BE:COB0"
 *      "M0_BE:SEG2" -> "M0_BE:COB0"
 *      "M0_BE:SEG2" -> "M0_BE:COB1"
 *      "M0_BE:COB1" -> "M0_BE:MDS"

 *      "M0_BE:AD1"  -> "M0_BE:BALLOC0"

 *
 * <b> Highlights </b>
 *
 * - While BE initialization, seg0 dictionary is scanned for a special records
 *   started with "M0_BE:". Values of these records are structures which have a
 *   special m0_be_0type stored inside, which is extracted and
 *   m0_be_0type::b0_init() is called on every such type. Metadata associated
 *   with m0_be_0type is not somehow related to confd but it can be node- or
 *   segment- related.
 *
 * - m0_be_0type::b0_init() initializes BE-internal objects like all segments
 *   and log and the sets volatile-only variables inside other subsystems for which
 *   m0_be_0types are defined.
 *
 * - In cases when subsystem needs to change one of its configuration parameters
 *   it calls  m0_be_0type_add() to peform changes in seg0 dictionary.
 *
 * <b>BE domain initialization</b>
 *
 * mkfs.be uses m0_be_0type_add() to populate the seg0 dictionary.
 *
 * <b>BE-internal objects: segments and log</b>
 *
 * Segments and log configuration options are stored inside seg0. Initialization
 * of these BE objects are more than just their volatile-only fields assignment and
 * it includes corresponding m0_stob lookup and steps needed to bring on-disk
 * and in-memory parts of these objects up.
 *
 * To perform such startup sequences the following functions are used for all
 * segments: m0_be_seg_init(), m0_be_seg_open(); and for log: m0_be_log_init(),
 * m0_be_log_open().  Accoringly to given interfaces, each segment has to have
 * the following set of metadata options: underlying stob options, domain
 * options, segment options; and log should have the following: underlying stob
 * options.
 *
 * <b> Metadata format </b>
 * Related metadata is stored inside seg0 dictionary and retrieved from it by
 * iteration of all records in dictionary with predefined prefix in its
 * keys (@todo dictionary has to be updated a little bit to do this).
 * Format of the key is the following:
 * "{ prefix } { separator } { 0type } { objname }"
 * Example: "M0_BE:COB1"
 *
 * The value of such dictionary record contains struct m0_buf representing a
 * pointer and size of an object which is being brought up. It has to be casted
 * inside concrete ->b0_init() and used as options for concrete m0_be_0type to
 * perform initialization.
 *

 *           opt = segobj_opt_next(dict, opt, objtype))
