 * @section recovery-ovw Recovery overview
 * BE allows users to modify segments in transactional way. A segment is backed
 * with a linux stob, which doesn't provide atomic writes. BE should have
 * consistent segments even after crash. Therefore BE should have a part that
 * can recover BE segments data after crash. This part is called recovery.
 *
 * @section recovery-def Definitions
 *
 * - <b>Recovery</b> is process of consistency reconstruction of segments, which
 *   current BE domain contains of.
 * - <b>Log</b> is persistent storage where transactions are written before they
 *   are placed to segment.
 * - <b>Valid group</b> is a transaction group that is fully logged and contains
 *   complete commit block with proper magic and checksum.
 * - <b>Log-only group</b> is group that was completely logged but it's not
 *   known if it was placed.
 * - <b>Dirty bit</b> is a flag that indicates whether BE was shut down
 *   correctly or not during previous run.
 *
 * @section recovery-req Requirements
 *
 * - On successful recovery completion segments have to contain only complete
 *   and not partial transactions.
 * - Recovery shouldn't take long after normal shutdown;
 * - Recovery time is not important (yet);
 * - Log is stored on persistent storage with random access.
 *
 * Recovery should be started and succeed after:
 * - Power loss;
 * - m0d crash:
 *    - OOM m0d kill;
 *    - SIGSEGV or other signal.
 * - Recovery should succeed if some of the above failures happen during recovery.
 *
 * Recovery may fail after:
 * - Memory corruption;
 * - Segment or log corruption;
 * - I/O error in segment or log;
 *
 * @section recovery-depends Dependencies
 * Recovery depends on these BE components:
 * - log;
 * - engine;
 * - tx_group;
 * - seg0.
 *
 * @section recovery-lspec Logical Specification
 *
 * - @ref recovery-lspec-comps
 * - @ref recovery-lspec-sub
 *
 * @subsection recovery-lspec-comps Component Overview
 * The following BE subsystems are involved into recovery process, so they have
 * to be updated according to the list:
 * - <b>Engine</b> starts recovery process inside m0_be_domain_start(). Recovery
 *   process is started every time engine starts. It analyses special bits
 *   inside seg0 and starts re-applying groups of transactions stored in Log to
 *   make filesystem stored in be segments consistent.
 * - <b>Log</b> stores groups of transactions in order to perform durability of
 *   BE storage. For recovery process, it has to provide interface or functions
 *   for efficient iteration of the groups stored inside. Algorithm has to
 *   iterate groups from last placed to last logged.
 * - <b>Seg0</b> is a storage of metadata related to the filesystem. Recovery
 *   needs to store inside seg0 special bit, analysing which it makes a decision
 *   to start log scanning and groups re-applying. These bit (dirty bit) have to
 *   be set or cleared with a special (non-transactional) procedure and it can
 *   be stored in struct m0_be_seg_hdr nearby the start of the segment. In
 *   future, some redundancy can be added: dirty bit can be stored in different
 *   places of the segment.
 * - <b>Recovery</b> encapsulates a set of algorithms and data structures and
 *   formats which are needed to make data stored inside BE segments consistent
 *   during failures.
 * - From recovery point of view <b>PageD</b> are special interfaces which have
 *   to be used to apply changes to in-memory representation of the segments.
 *   Using m0_be_reg_{get,put}() interface recovery loads the page, where data
 *   corresponding to the scanned group region area lives to apply changes to
 *   the region.
 *
 * @subsection recovery-lspec-sub Component Subroutines
 * <b>Scanning algorithm which finds last logged group and last placed group</b>
 * Log header contains pointer to a valid logged group. Scanning algorithm
 * begins from the pointed group. Groups are scanned in both forward and
 * backward directions. Lsn must follow with increasing order, therefore
 * scanning algorithm repeats while lsn is increased for the forward scanning
 * and while lsn is decreased for backward scanning respectively. Last logged
 * group must be the last handled group during the forward scanning. It
 * contains pointer to last placed group.
 *
 * Backward scanning is stopped if the following condition is met: lsn of the
 * current group is less than lsn of the last placed group.
 *
 * Note: BE log operates with a log record that is representation of
 * transactional group in the log.
 *
 * <b>Iterative interface for looking over groups that need to be re-applied</b>
 * Recovery provides interface for pick next group for re-applying.
