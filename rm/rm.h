/**
 * @defgroup rm Resource management
 *
 * A resource is an entity in Motr for which a notion of ownership can be
 * well-defined. See the HLD referenced below for more details.
 *
 * In Motr almost everything is a resource, except for the low-level
 * types that are used to implement the resource framework.
 *
 * Resource management is split into two parts:
 *
 *   -# generic functionality, implemented by the code in rm/ directory and
 *   -# resource type specific functionality.
 *
 * These parts interact through the operation vectors (m0_rm_resource_ops,
 * m0_rm_resource_type_ops and m0_rm_credit_ops) provided by a resource type
 * and called by the generic code. Type specific code, in turn, calls
 * generic entry-points described in the @b Resource type interface
 * section.
 *
 * In the documentation below, responsibilities of generic and type specific
 * parts of the resource manager are delineated.
 *
 * @b Overview
 *
 * A resource (m0_rm_resource) is associated with various file system entities:
 *
 *   - file meta-data. Credits to use this resource can be thought of as locks
 *     on file attributes that allow them to be cached or modified locally;
 *
 *   - file data. Credits to use this resource are extents in the file plus
 *     access mode bits (read, write);
 *
 *   - free storage space on a server (a "grant" in Lustre
 *     terminology). Credit to use this resource is a reservation of a given
 *     number of bytes;
 *
 *   - quota;
 *
 *   - many more, see the HLD for examples.
 *
 * A resource owner (m0_rm_owner) represents a collection of credits to use a
 * particular resource.
 *
 * \image html RM-data-structs.svg
 *
 * To use a resource, a user of the resource manager creates an incoming
 * resource request (m0_rm_incoming), that describes a wanted usage credit
 * (m0_rm_credit_get()). Sometimes the request can be fulfilled immediately,
 * sometimes it requires changes in the credit ownership. In the latter case
 * outgoing requests are directed to the remote resource owners (which typically
 * means a network communication) to collect the wanted usage credit at the
 * owner. When an outgoing request reaches its target remote domain, an incoming
 * request is created and processed (which in turn might result in sending
 * further outgoing requests). Eventually, a reply is received for the outgoing
 * request. When incoming request processing is complete, it "pins" the wanted
 * credit. This credit can be used until the incoming request structure is
 * destroyed (m0_rm_credit_put()) and the pin is released.
 *
 * See the documentation for individual resource management data-types and
 * interfaces for more detailed description of their behaviour.
 *
 * @b Terminology.
 *
 * Various terms are used to described credit flow of the resources in a
 * cluster.
 *
 * Owners of credits for a particular resource are arranged in a cluster-wide
 * hierarchy. This hierarchical arrangement depends on system structure (e.g.,
 * where devices are connected, how network topology looks like) and dynamic
 * system behaviour (how accesses to a resource are distributed).
 *
 * Originally, all credits on the resource belong to a single owner or a set of
 * owners, residing on some well-known servers. Proxy servers request and cache
 * credits from there. Lower level proxies and clients request credits in
 * turn. According to the order in this hierarchy, one distinguishes "upward"
 * and "downward" owners relative to a given one.
 *
 * In a given ownership transfer operation, a downward owner is "debtor" and
 * upward owner is "creditor". The credit being transferred is called a "loan"
 * (note that this word is used only as a noun). When a credit is transferred
 * from a creditor to a debtor, the latter "borrows" and the former "sub-lets"
 * the loan. When a credit is transferred in the other direction, the creditor
 * "revokes" and debtor "returns" the loan.
 *
 * A debtor can voluntarily return a loan. This is called a "cancel" operation.
 *
 * <b> Concurrency control. </b>
 *
 * Generic resource manager makes no assumptions about threading model used by
 * its callers. Generic resource data-structures and code are thread safe.
 *
 * 3 types of locks protect all generic resource manager states:
 *
 *   - per domain m0_rm_domain::rd_lock. This lock serialises addition and
 *     removal of resource types. Typically, it won't be contended much after
 *     the system start-up;
 *
 *   - per resource type m0_rm_resource_type::rt_lock. This lock is taken
 *     whenever a resource or a resource owner is created or
 *     destroyed. Typically, that would be when a file system object is
 *     accessed which is not in the cache;
 *
 *   - per resource owner m0_rm_owner::ro_lock.
 *     These locks protect a bulk of generic resource management state:
 *
 *       - lists of possessed, borrowed and sub-let usage credits;
 *       - incoming requests and their state transitions;
 *       - outgoing requests and their state transitions;
 *       - pins (m0_rm_pin).
 *
 *     Owner lock is accessed (taken and released) at least once during
 *     processing of an incoming request. Main owner state machine logic
 *     (owner_balance()) is structured in a way that is easily adaptable to a
 *     finer grained logic.
 *
 * None of these locks are ever held while waiting for a network communication
 * to complete.
 *
 * Lock ordering:
 *   -# m0_rm_owner::ro_lock
 *   -# m0_rm_resource_type::rt_lock
 *
 * <b>A group of cooperating owners.</b>
 *
 * The owners in a group coordinate their activities internally (by means
 * outside of resource manager control) as far as resource management is
 * concerned.
 *
 * Resource manager assumes that credits granted to the owners from the same
 * group never conflict.
 *
 * Typical usage is to assign all owners from the same distributed
 * transaction (or from the same network client) to a group. The decision
 * about a group scope has concurrency related implications, because the
 * owners within a group must coordinate access between themselves to
 * maintain whatever scheduling properties are desired, like serialisability.
 *
 * @b Liveness.
 *
 * None of the resource manager structures, except for m0_rm_resource, require
 * reference counting, because their liveness is strictly determined by the
 * liveness of an "owning" structure into which they are logically embedded.
 *
 * The resource structure (m0_rm_resource) can be shared between multiple
 * resource owners (m0_rm_owner) and its liveness is determined by the
 * reference counting (m0_rm_resource::r_ref).
 *
 * As in many other places in Motr, liveness of "global" long-living
 * structures (m0_rm_domain, m0_rm_resource_type) is managed by the upper
 * layers which are responsible for determining when it is safe to finalise
 * the structures. Typically, an upper layer would achieve this by first
 * stopping and finalising all possible resource manager users.
 *
 * Similarly, a resource owner (m0_rm_owner) liveness is not explicitly
 * determined by the resource manager. It is up to the user to determine when
 * an owner (which can be associated with a file, or a client, or a similar
 * entity) is safe to be finalised.
 *
 * When a resource owner is finalised (ROS_FINALISING) it tears down the credit
 * network by revoking the loans it sublet to and by retuning the loans it
 * borrowed from other owners.
 *

/**
 * A representation of a resource owner from another domain.
 *
 * This is a generic structure.
 *
 * m0_rm_remote is a portal through which interaction with the remote resource
 * owners is transacted. m0_rm_remote state transitions happen under its
 * resource's lock.
 *
 * A remote owner is needed to borrow from or sub-let to an owner in a different
 * domain. To establish the communication between local and remote owner the
 * following stages are needed:
 *
 *     - a service managing the remote owner must be located in the
 *       cluster. The particular way to do this depends on a resource type. For
 *       some resource types, the service is immediately known. For example, a
 *       "grant" (i.e., a reservation of a free storage space on a data
 *       service) is provided by the data service, which is already known by
 *       the time the grant is needed. For such resource types,
 *       m0_rm_remote::rem_state is initialised to REM_SERVICE_LOCATED. For
 *       other resource types, a distributed resource location data-base is
 *       consulted to locate the service. While the data-base query is going
 *       on, the remote owner is in REM_SERVICE_LOCATING state;
 *
 *     - once the service is known, the owner within the service should be
 *       located. This is done generically, by sending a resource management fop
 *       to the service. The service responds with the remote owner identifier
 *       (m0_rm_remote::rem_cookie) used for further communications. The service
 *       might respond with an error, if the owner is no longer there. In this
 *       case, m0_rm_state::rem_state goes back to REM_SERVICE_LOCATING.
 *
 *       Owner identification is an optional step, intended to optimise remote
 *       service performance. The service should be able to deal with the
 *       requests without the owner identifier. Because of this, owner
 *       identification can be piggy-backed to the first operation on the
 *       remote owner.

/**
 * Resource ownership is used for two purposes:
 *
 *  - concurrency control. Only resource owner can manipulate the resource
 *    and ownership transfer protocol assures that owners do not step on
 *    each other. That is, resources provide traditional distributed
 *    locking mechanism;
 *
 *  - replication control. Resource owner can create a (local) copy of a
 *    resource. The ownership transfer protocol with the help of version
 *    numbers guarantees that multiple replicas are re-integrated
 *    correctly. That is, resources provide a cache coherency
 *    mechanism. Global cluster-wide cache management policy can be
 *    implemented on top of resources.
 *
 * A resource owner possesses credits on a particular resource. Multiple
 * owners within the same domain can possess credits on the same resource,
 * but no two owners in the cluster can possess conflicting credits at the
 * same time. The last statement requires some qualification:
 *
 *  - "time" here means the logical time in an observable history of the
 *    file system. It might so happen, that at a certain moment in physical
 *    time, data-structures (on different nodes, typically) would look as
 *    if conflicting credits were granted, but this is only possible when
 *    such credits will never affect visible system behaviour (e.g., a
 *    consensual decision has been made by that time to evict one of the
 *    nodes);
 *
 *  - in a case of optimistic conflict resolution, "no conflicting credits"
 *    means "no credits on which conflicts cannot be resolved afterwards by
 *    the optimistic conflict resolution policy".
 *
 * m0_rm_owner is a generic structure, created and maintained by the
 * generic resource manager code.
 *
 * Off a m0_rm_owner, hang several lists and arrays of lists for credits
 * book-keeping: m0_rm_owner::ro_borrowed, m0_rm_owner::ro_sublet and
 * m0_rm_owner::ro_owned[], further subdivided by states.
 *
 * As credits form a lattice (see m0_rm_credit_ops), it is always possible to
 * represent the cumulative sum of all credits on a list as a single
 * m0_rm_credit. The reason the lists are needed is that credits in the lists
 * have some additional state associated with them (e.g., loans for
 * m0_rm_owner::ro_borrowed, m0_rm_owner::ro_sublet or pins
 * (m0_rm_credit::cr_pins) for m0_rm_owner::ro_owned[]) that can be manipulated
 * independently.

/**
 * Resource usage credit request.
 *
 * The same m0_rm_incoming structure is used to track state of the incoming
 * requests both "local", i.e., from the same domain where the owner resides
 * and "remote".
 *
 * An incoming request is created for
 *
 *     - local credit request, when some user wants to use the resource;
 *
 *     - remote credit request from a "downward" owner which asks to sub-let
 *       some credits;
 *
 *     - remote credit request from an "upward" owner which wants to revoke some
 *       credits.
 *
 * These usages are differentiated by m0_rm_incoming::rin_type.
 *
 * An incoming request is a state machine, going through the following stages:
 *
 *     - [CHECK]   This stage determines whether the request can be fulfilled
 *                 immediately. Local request can be fulfilled immediately if
 *                 the wanted credit is possessed by the owner, that is, if
 *                 in->rin_want is implied by a join of owner->ro_owned[].
 *
 *                 A non-local (loan or revoke) request can be fulfilled
 *                 immediately if the wanted credit is implied by a join of
 *                 owner->ro_owned[OWOS_CACHED], that is, if the owner has
 *                 enough credits to grant the loan and the wanted credit does
 *                 not conflict with locally held credits.
 *
 *     - [POLICY]  If the request can be fulfilled immediately, the "policy" is
 *                 invoked which decides which credit should be actually
 *                 granted, sublet or revoked. That credit can be larger than
 *                 requested. A policy is, generally, resource type dependent,
 *                 with a few universal policies defined by enum
 *                 m0_rm_incoming_policy.
 *
 *     - [SUCCESS] Finally, fulfilled request succeeds.
 *
 *     - [ISSUE]   Otherwise, if the request can not be fulfilled immediately,
 *                 "pins" (m0_rm_pin) are added which will notify the request
 *                 when the fulfillment check might succeed.
 *
 *                 Pins are added to:
 *
 *                     - every conflicting credit held by this owner (when
 *                       RIF_LOCAL_WAIT flag is set on the request and always
 *                       for a remote request);
 *
 *                     - outgoing requests to revoke conflicting credits sub-let
 *                       to remote owners (when RIF_MAY_REVOKE flag is set);
 *
 *                     - outgoing requests to borrow missing credits from remote
 *                       owners (when RIF_MAY_BORROW flag is set);
 *
 *                     - reserved credits if current request has smaller reserve
 *                       priority;
 *
 *                 Outgoing requests mentioned above are created as necessary
 *                 in the ISSUE stage.
 *
 *     - [CYCLE]   When all the pins stuck in the ISSUE state are released
 *                 (either when a local credit is released or when an outgoing
 *                 request completes or when reserved credits are granted),
 *                 go back to the CHECK state.
 *
 * Looping back to the CHECK state is necessary, because possessed non-reserved
 * credits are not "pinned" during wait and can go away (be revoked or sub-let).
 * The credits are not pinned to avoid dependencies between credits that can
 * lead to dead-locks and "cascading evictions". But in this case there is
 * possibility of live-lock.
 *
 * The alternative is to use RIF_RESERVE flag that leads to pinning credits with
 * M0_RPF_BARRIER. Dead-locks are avoided by determining global strict ordering
 * between such requests using "reserve priority" (@ref m0_rm_reserve_prio).
 * Reserve priority is assigned once to the local incoming request and then
 * inherited by all remote requests created in sake of that local request
 * fulfillment. Therefore reserve priorities are handled consistently through
 * the whole cluster.
 *
 * Reserve priorities are used only to avoid possible dead-locks and live-locks.
 * There is no guarantee that request with higher reserve priority will be fully
 * fulfilled before request with lower reserve priority.
 *
 * If probability of a live-lock is low enough then using incoming requests
 * without RIF_RESERVE flag is preferable.
 *
 * How many outgoing requests are sent out in ISSUE state is a matter of
 * policy. The fewer requests are sent, the more CHECK-ISSUE-WAIT loop
 * iterations would typically happen. An extreme case of sending no more than a
 * single request is also possible and has some advantages: outgoing request can
 * be allocated as part of incoming request, simplifying memory management.
 *
 * It is also a matter of policy, how exactly the request is satisfied after a
 * successful CHECK state. Suppose, for example, that the owner possesses
 * credits C0 and C1 such that wanted credit W is implied by join(C0, C1), but
 * neither C0 nor C1 alone imply W. Some possible CHECK outcomes are:
 *
 *     - increase user counts in both C0 and C1;
 *
 *     - insert a new credit equal to W into owner->ro_owned[];
 *
 *     - insert a new credit equal to join(C0, C1) into owner->ro_owned[].
 *
 * All have their advantages and drawbacks:
 *
 *     - elevating C0 and C1 user counts keeps owner->ro_owned[] smaller, but
 *       pins more credits than strictly necessary;
 *
 *     - inserting W behaves badly in a standard use case where a thread doing
 *       sequential IO requests a credit on each iteration;
 *
 *     - inserting the join pins more credits than strictly necessary.
 *
 * All policy questions are settled by per-request flags and owner settings,
 * based on access pattern analysis.
 *
 * Following is a state diagram, where stages that are performed without
 * blocking (for network communication) are lumped into a single state:

/**
 * A pin is used to:
 *
 *   - M0_RPF_TRACK: track when a credit changes its state;
 *   - M0_RPF_PROTECT: to protect a credit from revocation;
 *   - M0_RPF_BARRIER: to prohibit granting credit to another request.
 *
 * Fields of this struct are protected by the owner's lock.
 *
 * Abstractly speaking, pins allow N:M (many to many) relationships between
 * incoming requests and credits: an incoming request has a list of pins
 * "from" it and a credit has a list of pins "to" it. A typical use case
 * is as follows:
 *
 * @b Protection
 *
 * While a credit is actively used, it cannot be revoked. For example,
 * while file write is going on, the credit to write in the target file
 * extent must be held. A credit is held (or pinned) from the return from
 * m0_rm_credit_get() until the matching call to m0_rm_credit_put(). To
 * mark the credit as pinned, m0_rm_credit_get() adds a M0_RPF_PROTECT
 * pin from the incoming request to the returned credit (generally, more
 * than one credit can be pinned as result on m0_rm_credit_get()). This
 * pin is removed by the call to m0_rm_credit_put().
 *
 * Multiple incoming requests can pin the same credit.
 *
 * @b Tracking
 *
 * M0_RPF_TRACK pin is added from the incoming request to the credit when:
 *
 *   - An incoming request with a RIF_LOCAL_WAIT flag needs to wait until a
 *     conflicting pinned credit becomes unpinned;
 *
 *   - An incoming request need to wait until reserved credit pinned
 *     with M0_RPF_BARRIER is unpinned;
 *
 *   - An incoming request needs to wait for outgoing request completion.
 *
 * When the last M0_RPF_PROTECT pin is removed from a credit (credit
 * becomes "cached") or M0_RPF_BARRIER pin is removed, then the list of
 * pins to the credit is scanned. For each M0_RPF_TRACK pin on the list,
 * its incoming request is checked to see whether this was the last
 * tracking pin the request is waiting for.
 *
 * An incoming request might also issue an outgoing request to borrow or
 * revoke some credits, necessary to fulfill the request. An M0_RPF_TRACK
 * pin is added from the incoming request to the credit embedded in the
 * outgoing request (m0_rm_outgoing::rog_want::rl_credit). Multiple incoming
 * requests can pin the same outgoing request. When the outgoing request
 * completes, the incoming requests waiting for it are checked as above.
 *
 * @b Barrier
 *
 * Barrier is necessary to avoid live-locks and guarantee progress of
 * incoming request processing by pinning the credits with a M0_RPF_BARRIER
 * pin. Only RIF_RESERVE requests pin credits with a M0_RPF_BARRIER.
 *
 * A credit pinned with M0_RPF_BARRIER is called "reserved". Only one
 * incoming request can reserve the credit at any given time, others
 * should wait completion of this incoming request (by placing M0_RPF_TRACK
 * pin, as usual).
 *
 * It is possible that already reserved credit should be reassigned to
 * another incoming request with higher reserve priority than the current
 * one reserving the credit (@ref m0_rm_incoming). Such situation is called
 * "barrier overcome".
 *
 * M0_RPF_BARRIER pins are not set for outgoing requests, but they set on
 * outgoing requests replies in the following way. When the request is
 * complete and credit is placed at owner->ro_owned[OWOS_CACHED] list, we
 * check if there are any correspondent RIF_RESERVE incoming requests who
 * pinned it with M0_RPF_TRACK. If there are, the highest priority one is
 * selected and the credit is pinned for it with M0_RPF_BARRIER. It is done
 * this way to add M0_RPF_BARRIER before any other waiting for the same
 * credit request could be excited and possibly grab the credit.
 *
