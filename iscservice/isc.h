   @section iscservice-highlights Design Highlights

   The in-storage-compute service (iscs) provides a platform to perform
   computations on data stored with Motr. This enables Motr users to perform
   concurrent computation on stored data along with minimal network
   communication. The computations on data can range from linear algebraic
   operations or Fast Fourier Transform, to searching of a string (distributed
   grep) across Motr nodes. ISC service facilitates these computations
   by providing two types of interfaces:
	- Low level interface
	- Sandboxing

   Low-level interface is designed for computations "trusted" by Motr. It can be
   thought of as a system call which after being invoked triggers a
   preregistered computation on Motr side. The Motr trusted applications can
   use the internal Motr infrastructure (fom scheduler/stob I/O etc.) and hence
   the ISC service does not perform any task on behalf of the computation.

   Sandboxing is for applications not having a direct access to Motr
   internals. They can request data from Motr and can then apply the
   appropriate computation.

   @section iscservice-low-level Low Level Interface

   Low level interface can be used in two ways:
	- m0_isc_comp_req_exec: this API supports a local invocation of a
	  registered function. It's an asynchronous call which executes
	  a registered callback on completion.
	- Using fop/fom mechanism: supports remote invocation. Arguments and
	  results to be returned are communicated over a network.

  Computations registered with the service are stored in an in-memory hash
  table. It's worth noting that the service remains oblivious to the details of
  the function, including IO or network access. Since Motr uses a non-preemptive
  request handler, a service fom is expected to yield the cpu core whenever it's
  waiting on an external event. In order to be aligned with this semantics, a
  computation is expected to convey its state (see m0_fom_state) to its caller
  fom.

  A typical use-case of isc service is described below:
  -All computations registered with ISC service low-level framework shall
   confine to the following signature:
  @verbatim
	int comp(struct m0_buf *args, struct m0_buf *out,
		 struct m0_isc_comp_private *comp_data, int *rc)
  @endverbatim
  - "out" holds the result of a computation while "rc" captures an error code
    if any. The returned value of computation shall be either of M0_FSO_AGAIN
    and M0_FSO_WAIT. In case the computation needs to be re-invoked, "rc" shall
    hold "-EAGAIN". A detailed semantics of return value and error code is
    available in "ISC Service user guide" (please see below for the link).
  - While using external libraries it's necessary to prepare a wrapper over
    the library APIs to convert them to the above mentioned signature.
  - A library is expected to have a function "motr_lib_init()". When library
    is linked (via m0_spiel_process_lib_load()), this function will be called
    which can then register relevant library APIs with Motr.
  - An API is registered with Motr using m0_isc_comp_register(). A unique
    identifier (m0_fid) associated with the API is used to store it in the
    internal hash table.
  - A user of the computation can invoke it either using m0_comp_req_exec()
    or by sending m0_fop_isc. In both cases a fid of the computation
    is provided to invoke the same. In the later case the results are
    communicated using RPC adaptive transmission buffers (m0_rpc_at_buf).

  @section iscservice-sandboxing Sandboxing

  Sandboxing is used by applications that don't have an access to Motr
  internals. Computations involved in sandboxing will communicate with
  Motr instance over a shared memory segment (or POSIX message queues).

  @section iscservice-layout_plan Layout Plans

  File layout maps logical offset from a file to logical offset from available
  device(s). In order to schedule computations over data it's necessary to know
  the interdependency of operations, and this is where the layout access plan
  is required. Kindly refer "layout/plan.h" for detailed documentation.
