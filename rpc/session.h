@section Overview

Session module of rpc layer has two objectives:

- If some rpc-items need to be delivered to receiver in same sequence in
  which sender has submitted them, then it is the session module which
  ensures that the items are delivered in FIFO sequence.

- To provide exactly once semantics.
  see http://www.cs.unc.edu/~dewan/242/s06/notes/ipc/node30.html

Aproach taken by session module to achive these two objectives, is similar
to session-slot implementation in NFSv4.1

See section 2.10.6 of rfc 5661 NFSv4.1
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5661#section-2.10.6

Session module defines following types of objects:
- rpc connection @see m0_rpc_conn
- rpc session @see m0_rpc_session

Out of these, m0_rpc_conn and m0_rpc_session are visible to user.

Session module uses following types of objects:
- rpc machine @see m0_rpc_machine
- rpc item @see m0_rpc_item.

<B> Relationships among objects: </B>
rpc_machine has two lists of rpc connections.
- Outgoing connections: Contains m0_rpc_conn objects for which this node is
sender.
- Incoming connections: Contains m0_rpc_conn objects for which this node is
receiver.

Rpc connection has a list of rpc sessions, which are created on this
connection. A rpc connection cannot be terminated until all the sessions
created on the connection are terminated.

Each object of type [m0_rpc_conn|m0_rpc_session] on sender
has counterpart object of same type on receiver. (Note: same structure
definitions are used on both sender and receiver side)

 <B> Using two identifiers for session and conn </B>
 @todo
 currently, receiver assigns identifiers to connections and sessions and
 these identifiers are used by both parties. What we can do, is to allow
 sender to assign identifiers to sessions (this identifier is sent in
 SESSION_ESTABLISH). Then, whenever receiver uses the session to send a
 reply, it uses this identifier (instead of receiver assigned session-id).
 The advantage of this, is that sender can use an identifier that allows
 quick lookup (e.g., an index in some session array or simply a pointer).
 Similarly for connections (i.e., another sender generated identifier in
 addition to uuid, that is not guaranteed to be globally unique)

    @todo
	- Generate ADDB data points for important session events
	- store replies in FOL
	- Optimization: Cache misordered items at receiver, rather than
	  discarding them.

/**
   Rpc connection can be shared by multiple entities (e.g. users) by
   creating their own "session" on the connection.
   A session can be used to maintain authentication information or QoS
   parameters.

   <B> Liveness: </B>

   On sender side, allocation and deallocation of m0_rpc_session is entirely
   managed by user except for SESSION 0. SESSION 0 is allocated and deallocated
   by rpc-layer internally along with m0_rpc_conn.
   @see m0_rpc_conn for more information on creation and use of SESSION 0.

   On receiver side, m0_rpc_session object will be allocated and deallocated
   by rpc-layer internally, in response to session create and session terminate
   requests respectively.

   <B> Concurrency:</B>

   Users of rpc-layer are never expected to take lock on session. Rpc layer
   will internally synchronise access to m0_rpc_session.

   All access to session are synchronized using
   session->s_conn->c_rpc_machine->rm_sm_grp.s_lock.

   When session is in one of INITIALISED, TERMINATED, FINALISED and
   FAILED state, user is expected to serialise access to the session object.
   (It is assumed that session, in one of {INITIALISED, TERMINATED, FAILED,
    FINALISED} states, does not have concurrent users).

   Receiver is not expected to call any of these APIs. Receiver side session
   structures will be set-up while handling fops
   m0_rpc_fop_[conn|session]_[establish|terminate].

   When receiver needs to post reply, it uses m0_rpc_reply_post().

   @code
   m0_rpc_reply_post(request_item, reply_item);
   @endcode

   m0_rpc_reply_post() will copy all the session related information from
   request item to reply item and process reply item.

   Note: rpc connection is a two-way communication channel. There are requests
   and corresponding reply items, on the same connection. Receiver NEED NOT
   have to establish other separate connection with sender, to be able to
   send replies.
