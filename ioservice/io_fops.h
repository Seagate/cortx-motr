   @section bulkclient-fspec-ds Data Structures

   The io bulk client design includes data structures like
   - m0_io_fop An in-memory definition of io fop which binds the io fop
   with its network buffer.

   @section bulkclient-fspec-sub Subroutines

   @subsection bulkclient-fspec-sub-cons Constructors and Destructors

   - m0_io_fop_init() - Initializes the m0_io_fop structure.

   - m0_io_fop_fini() - Finalizes a m0_io_fop structure.

   @subsection bulkclient-fspec-sub-acc Accessors and Invariants

   - m0_fop_to_rpcbulk() - Retrieves struct m0_rpc_bulk from given m0_fop.

   @subsection bulkclient-fspec-sub-opi Operational Interfaces

   @section bulkclient-fspec-cli Command Usage
   Not Applicable.

   @section bulkclient-fspec-usecases Recipes

   Using bulk APIs on client side.
   - IO bulk client allocates memory for a m0_io_fop and invokes
   m0_io_fop_init() by providing fop type.
   - IO bulk client invokes m0_rpc_bulk_buf_databuf_add() till all pages
   or user buffers are added to m0_rpc_bulk structure and then invokes
   - Bulk client invokes m0_rpc_bulk_store() to store the network buffer
   memory descriptor/s to io fop wire format. The network buffer memory
   descriptor is retrieved after adding the network buffer to transfer
   machine belonging to m0_rpc_machine.
   - Bulk client invokes m0_rpc_post() to submit the fop to rpc layer.
   - The network buffers added by bulk client to m0_rpc_bulk structure
   are removed and deallocated by network buffer completion callbacks.
   Bulk client user need not remove or deallocate these network buffers
   by itself.
   The m0_io_fop structure can be populated and used like this.

   @code

   m0_io_fop_init(iofop, ftype);
   do {
	m0_rpc_bulk_buf_add(&iofop->if_rbulk, rbuf);
	..
	m0_rpc_bulk_buf_databuf_add(rbuf, buf, count, index);
	..
   } while (not_empty);
   ..
   m0_rpc_bulk_buf_store(rbuf, rpcitem, net_buf_desc);
   ..
   m0_rpc_post(rpc_item);
   m0_rpc_reply_timedwait(rpc_item);
   m0_io_fop_fini(iofop);

   @endcode

   Using bulk APIs on server side.
   - Motr io server program (ioservice) creates a m0_rpc_bulk structure
   and invokes m0_rpc_bulk_init().
   - Ioservice invokes m0_rpc_bulk_buf_add() to attach buffers to the
   m0_rpc_bulk structure.
   - Typically, ioservice uses a pre-allocated and pre-registered pool of
   network buffers which are supposed to be used while doing bulk transfer.
   These buffers are provided while invoking m0_rpc_bulk_buf_add() API.
   - Ioservice invokes m0_rpc_bulk_load() to start the zero copy of data from
   sender.
   Since server side sends the reply fop, it does not need m0_io_fop
   structures since it deals with request IO fops.

   @see m0_rpc_bulk
   @code

   m0_rpc_bulk_init(rbulk);
   do {
	   m0_rpc_bulk_buf_add(rbulk->rbuf, segs_nr, length, netdom, nb, &out);
	   ..
	   ..
   } while(request_io_fop->io_buf_desc_list is not finished);

   m0_clink_init(&clink, NULL);
   m0_clink_add_lock(&rbulk->rb_chan, &clink);
   m0_rpc_bulk_buf_load(rbulk, conn, &request_io_fop->desc_list);
   ..
   m0_chan_wait(&clink);
   ..
   send_reply_fop();
   m0_rpc_bulk_fini(rbulk);
