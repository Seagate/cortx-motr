   @section DLD-bulk-server-fspec Functional Specification
   This section describes the data structure, external interfaces of the
   component and briefly identifies the consumers of these interfaces.

   @subsection DLD-bulk-server-fspec-ds Data structures

   I/O FOMs use the following data structure:

   The Bulk I/O Service is required to maintain run-time context of I/O FOMs.
   The data structure @ref m0_io_fom_cob_rw maintain required context data.

   - Pointer to generic FOM structure<br>
     This holds the information about generic FOM (e.g. its generic states,
     type, locality, reply FOP, file operation log etc.)
   - Total number of descriptor for bulk data transfer requested.
   - Current network buffer descriptor index
   - Current index vector list index
   - Batch size for bulk I/O processing.
   - Actual data transferd.
   - STOB identifier<br>
     Storage object identifier which tells the actual device on which I/O
     operation intended.
   - List of STOB operation vector<br>
     This holds the information required for async STOB I/O (e.g. data segments,
     operations, channel to signal on completion etc.)
   - List acquired network buffers pointer<br>
     zero-copy fills this buffers in bulk I/O case.

   @subsection DLD-bulk-server-fspec-if Interfaces
   Bulk I/O Service will be implemented as read FOM and write FOM. Since
   request handler processes FOM, each FOM needs to define its operations:

   Bulk I/O FOM type operations:

   @verbatim
   m0_io_fom_cob_rw_create()    Request handler uses this interface to
                                create I/O FOM.
   @endverbatim

   Bulk I/O FOM operations :

   @verbatim
   m0_io_fom_cob_rw_locality_get()   Request handler uses this interface to
                                     get the locality for this I/O FOM.
   m0_io_fom_cob_rw_tick()           Request handler uses this interface to
                                     execute next phase of I/O FOM.
   m0_io_fom_cob_rw_fini()           Request handler uses this interface after
                                     I/O FOM finishes its execution.
   @endverbatim

   Bulk I/O Service type operations :

   @verbatim

   m0_io_service_init()       This interface will be called by request handler
                              to create & initiate Bulk I/O Service.

   @endverbatim

   Bulk I/O Service operations :
   @verbatim

   m0_io_service_start()      This interface will be called by request handler
                              to start Buk I/O Service.

   m0_io_service_stop()       This interface will be called by request handler
                              to stop Buk I/O Service.

   m0_io_service_fini()       This interface will be called by request handler
                              to finish & de-allocate Bulk I/O Service.

   @endverbatim

   Bulk I/O FOM creation & initialization

   On receiving of bulk I/O FOP, FOM is created & initialized for respective
   FOP type. Then it is placed into FOM processing queue.
