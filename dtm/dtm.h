/**
 * @page dtm Distributed transaction manager
 *
 * @section Overview
 *
 * Distributed transaction manager (DTM) is a major Motr
 * component, responsible for dealing with certain types of transient failures.
 *
 * Specifically, DTM maintains, as far as possible, consistency of system state
 * in the face of transient network failures (message reordering and
 * duplication) and transient node failures (node failure followed by restart).
 *
 * Consistency is maintained by grouping state updates, represented by fops
 * (@ref m0_fop), in collections called "distributed transactions". DTM
 * guarantees that transactions are atomic, in the sense that either all or none
 * of the fops are executed, even should a failure happen in the middle of
 * transaction execution.
 *
 * Atomicity is achieved by redoing or undoing some fops after a failure. This
 * is done transparently by DTM, relieving its users from the burden of failure
 * handling.
 *
 * Because different transactions can update the same entities, undo and redo of
 * one transaction might require undo or redo of other dependent
 * transactions. To fulfil this requirement, DTM tracks transaction
 * dependencies.
 *
 * It might so happen, that too much state was lost in a failure and consistency
 * can not be restored. In this case, DTM determines the subset of system
 * history that is no longer consistent and notifies HA that affected nodes
 * should be anathematised.
 *
 * @section hld High level design
 * HLD :
 * For documentation links, please refer to this file :
 * doc/motr-design-doc-list.rst
 *
 * @section Abstractions
 *
 * DTM introduces the following major abstractions:
 *
 *     - dtm instance (m0_dtm, dtm/dtm.c, dtm/dtm.h),
 *     - history (m0_dtm_history, dtm/history.c, dtm/history.h),
 *     - update (m0_dtm_update, dtm/update.c, dtm/update.h),
 *     - operation (m0_dtm_operation, dtm/operation.c, dtm/operation.h),
 *     - distributed transaction (m0_dtm_dtx, dtm/dtx.c, dtm/dtx.h),
 *     - domain (m0_dtm_domain, dtm/domain.c, dtm/domain.h).
 *
 * See the HLD for more details.
 *
 * @section Nucleus
 *
 * Nucleus is a sub-module within DTM, which contains core versioning and
 * ordering logic for histories, operations and updates. Nucleus introduces its
 * own types:
 *
 *     - nucleus m0_dtm_nu,
 *     - nucleus operation m0_dtm_op,
 *     - nucleus history m0_dtm_hi and
 *     - nucleus update m0_dtm_up
 *
 * Nuclear types are embedded in the appropriate DTM types. The rest of DTM
 * hides nucleus types and functions from DTM users.
 *
 * See dtm/nucleus.c, dtm/nucleus.h.
 *
 * @section coding-conventions Coding conventions
 *
 * Throughout the code, names of nuclear types, functions and variables use 2
 * letter abbreviations: @t nu (nucleus), @t hi (history), @t op (operation),
 * @t up (update).
 *
 * In the rest of DTM, longer names "history", "oper" and "update" are
 * used. "rem" is used as an abbreviation for "remote dtm instance"
 * (m0_dtm_remote).
 *
 * dtm_internal.h contains definitions and declarations that are used internally
 * by the DTM code.
 *
 * @todo Internal declarations leak in the global name-space. This should be
 * fixed by making them static and including dtm .c files in a single dtm/dtm.c
 * file.
 *
 * @section usage Outline of DTM usage patterns
 *
 * A typical interaction with DTM consists of the following steps:
 *
 *     - create a transaction (m0_dtm_dtx_init());
 *
 *     - create an operation (m0_dtm_oper_init());
 *
 *     - for each entity, modified by the operation, locate the history
 *       (m0_dtm_history), representing the entity;
 *
 *     - create an update and add it to the history and the operation
 *       (m0_dtm_update_init());
 *
 *     - when all updates are added to the operation, add the operation to the
 *       transaction (m0_dtm_dtx_add());
 *
 *     - create a fop, representing the update and associate it with the update;
 *
 *     - close the operation (m0_dtm_oper_close());
 *
 *     - repeat for other operations in the transaction;
 *
 *     - close the transaction (m0_dtm_dtx_close());
 *
 * @todo pack, unpack, fop.
 *
 * @section TOO Theory of operation
 *
 * First, read the HLD.
 *
 * A history (m0_dtm_history) is a piece of system state to which updates are
 * applied sequentially. Some histories correspond to user-visible entities,
 * such as files, keys in meta-data tables, pages with file data; other
 * histories correspond to internal DTM entities, used to express grouping and
 * ordering of state updates. Examples of such internal histories are: fol
 * (m0_dtm_fol), distributed transaction (m0_dtm_dtx), local transaction
 * (m0_dtm_ltx), epoch, domain (m0_dtm_domain).
 *
 * An update to a history is m0_dtm_update. The list of updates is hanging off
 * of a history (@ref m0_dtm_history::h_hi::hi_ups), the latest update at the
 * head. An update is linked in its history list through
 * m0_dtm_update::upd_up::up_hi_linkage.
 *
 * Updates are grouped in operations (m0_dtm_oper). Updates of an operation hang
 * off of m0_dtm_oper::oprt_op::op_ups, linked through
 * m0_dtm_update::upd_up::up_op_linkage.
 *
 * Thus, updates, histories and operations form a certain gridiron pattern:
 * @anchor gridiron

 *
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * Note that operation groups updates for logical purposes, it doesn't imply any
 * kind of atomicity (more on operations below).
 *
 * Each update has 2 version numbers: m0_dtm_update::upd_up::up_ver and
 * m0_dtm_update::upd_up::up_orig_ver.
 *
 * Version number specifies a position in history. Version numbers are used to
 * order updates and to determine when an update is
 * applicable. m0_dtm_update::upd_up::up_orig_ver specifies the version the
 * history has before the update was applied and m0_dtm_update::upd_up::up_ver
 * specifies the version the history has after the update is applied. These 2
 * version numbers can coincide, when update doesn't change the entity,
 * represented by the history.
 *
 * Version 0 is "unknown version", see below. Version 1 is the version of the
 * history before the first (earliest) update in the history has been executed.
 *
 * The following 3 complementary sub-sections describe organization of DTM
 * structures from the point of view of update, history and operation
 * respectively.
 *
 * @section Update
 *
 * Each update has a state: m0_dtm_update::upd_up::up_state.
 *
 * When going through updates of a history pastward (that is, starting from the
 * head of the history update list, downward in the diagram above), version
 * numbers are non-increasing and states are non-decreasing.
 *
 * Update state determines the execution status of the update. Update state
 * increases throughout update life. Hence, update states describe update's life
 * stages. Updates states are the following (m0_dtm_state):
 *
 *     - LIMBO: a new update is initialised by m0_dtm_update_init(). From the
 *       very beginning the update is associated with an operation and a
 *       history. m0_dtm_update_init() places the update on the operation's list
 *       updates, but not on the history's list of updates. The update starts in
 *       LIMBO state and remains in this stats until the operation, to which the
 *       update belongs is closed. In other words, LIMBO is the state of updates
 *       belonging to still not closed operations. LIMBO is the only state, in
 *       which the update is not on its history update list. When an operation
 *       is closed, m0_dtm_op_close() places all its updates on the
 *       corresponding history lists.
 *
 *     - FUTURE: this is the state of updates from closed operations that are
 *	 not yet executed. Operation can be in FUTURE state for several reasons:
 *           - it is too early, and some previous operations, as determined by
 *             version numbers, are not yet added. This is possible when network
 *             reorders operations arriving to a server;
 *           - histories of some of operation's updates are busy (see PREPARE
 *             state below);
 *
 *     - PREPARE: when all updates of an operation are ready (versionwise) to be
 *       executed, they are moved from FUTURE to PREPARE state and
 *       m0_dtm_op_ops::doo_ready() call-back is called by the DTM. For a given
 *       history, at most one update of the history can be in PREPARE
 *       state. When an update is moved in PREPARE state, its history is marked
 *       busy (M0_DHF_BUSY) preventing other otherwise ready updates of this
 *       history to advance past FUTURE state. The purpose of PREPARE state is
 *       to allow DTM user to serialise operation execution as necessary, e.g.,
 *       take locks. When all the locks necessary for the operation execution
 *       are taken, the user calls m0_dtm_op_prepared(), which moves all
 *       operation updates in INPROGRESS state.
 *
 *     - INPROGRESS: an update in INPROGRESS state is being executed. When an
 *       update transitions from PREPARED to INPROGRESS state, history's version
 *       (m0_dtm_hi::hi_ver) is set to update's version, implying that as far as
 *       DTM is concerned, the state of the entity represented by the history
 *       contains the update. Because update execution is never truly
 *       instantaneous, the actual entity state is changed gradually, while the
 *       update is in INPROGRESS state, but thanks to the locks taken by the
 *       user in PREPARE state, this doesn't matter.
 *
 *     - VOLATILE: an update moves to VOLATILE state when its execution
 *       completes and modified entity state is present only in volatile store
 *       and can be lost in an allowed failure.
 *
 *     - PERSISTENT: an update moves to PERSISTENT state, when modified entity
 *       state makes it to persistent store, which is guaranteed to survive any
 *       allowed failure.
 *
 *     - STABLE: finally, an update moves to STABLE state, when DTM guarantees
 *       that it will survive any further allowed failure. STABLE state is
 *       different from PERSISTENT, because even if a particular update U is
 *       persistent, some earlier updates on which U depends can be not yet
 *       persistent. If such earlier updates are lost in a failure, DTM must
 *       undo U to preserve consistency.
 *
 * @section History
 *
 * History represents evolution of a storage entity. Storage entity changes as
 * result of update executions. Version number unambiguously identifies a point
 * in the history.
 *
 * History lists both already executed updates and still not executed
 * updates. m0_dtm_hi::hi_ver identifies the point in history corresponding to
 * the current state of the entity. All updates with version numbers less than
 * m0_dtm_hi::hi_ver have been executed and none of the updates with version
 * numbers greater than m0_dtm_hi::hi_ver executed. There can be multiple
 * updates with version numbers equal to m0_dtm_hi::hi_ver, all but one of them
 * must be read-only (because they do not change history version, see above), at
 * least one of such updates has been executed.
 *
 * History is "owned" (M0_DHF_OWNED) when the local DTM instance has the right
 * to assign version numbers in the history. This is possible when, for example,
 * local Motr instance owns an exclusive lock on the entity represented by the
 * history.
 *
 * Updates in a history are ordered in 3 ways:
 *
 *     - "list" ordering by their location in the history update list
 *       (m0_dtm_history::h_hi::hi_ups);
 *
 *     - "state" ordering by update state (m0_dtm_update::upd_up::up_state);
 *
 *     - "version" ordering by update version
 *       (m0_dtm_update::upd_up::up_ver). This ordering is partial, because some
 *       updates have "unknown" version (0).
 *
 * For updates in states VOLATILE and later, all 3 orderings coincide: for
 * updates X and Y, if X.state >= VOLATILE, then (X.state <= Y.state iff X.ver
 * <= Y.ver iff X is not later than Y in the update list). Moreover, such an
 * update has known (non 0) original version, which coincides with the version
 * of the update next in the list order.
 *
 * Updates in FUTURE state are not ordered, they form a set from which updates
 * are selected for execution as described below.
 *
 * Finally, updates in INPROGRESS state are only ordered by the list order,
 * which determines the order in which they left PREPARE state and in which they
 * enter VOLATILE state.
 *
 * Generally, updates in a history undergo the following process:
 *
 *     - at certain conditions (described below), advance_hi() scans the set of
 *       FUTURE updates, looking for an update ready for execution;
 *
 *     - if such an update is found, the update is moved in PREPARE state, the
 *       history is marked busy and m0_dtm_op_ops::doo_ready() call-back is
 *       called. This call-back belong to the update operation. All updates of
 *       an operation move to PREPARE state together. For owned histories,
 *       update version and original version are assigned at this moment
 *       (up_ready()), if they were unknown;
 *
 *     - when PREPARE state is complete, user calls m0_dtm_oper_prepared().
 *       This moves all updates of the operation in INPROGRESS state. This
 *       signifies that update started execution;
 *
 *     - when update execution is complete, user calls m0_dtm_oper_done(), which
 *       moves operation updates to VOLATILE state;
 *
 *     - later, when an update reaches a persistent store,
 *       m0_dtm_history_persistent() is called, which moves the update from
 *       VOLATILE to PERSISTENT state;
 *
 *     - finally, the update is moved to STABLE state.
 *
 * hi_advance() is called in the following cases:
 *
 *     - an operation closes (m0_dtm_op_close()), operation updates are moved to
 *       FUTURE state and added to their histories and
 *
 *     - m0_dtm_op_prepared() un-busies histories.
 *
 * Note that while update states are monotonically increasing, while the history
 * update list is traversed, some state-changing events can happen out of
 * order. Specifically, m0_dtm_oper_done() can be called, when some earlier (in
 * the list order) update is still INPROGRESS. In such cases update state
 * transition is postponed to preserve monotonicity.
 *
 * @section Operation
 *
 * An operation is a group of updates that change state (mostly) together.
 *
 * It's important to understand that operations are not (directly) related to
 * transactions, they are orthogonal. In fact, in the @ref gridiron diagram
 * above, operations (going horizontally) are literally *orthogonal* to
 * transactions, because the latter are implemented as (vertical) histories.
 *
 * An operation is initially open. Updates can be added to an open
 * operation. Such updates are in LIMBO state and are not attached to history
 * update lists. When the operation is closed by m0_dtm_oper_close(), all its
 * updates are moved to the FUTURE state. No further updates can be added to a
 * closed operation.
 *
 * By the time m0_dtm_oper_close() returns, operation updates might advance past
 * FUTURE state: if they are ready for the execution (see above), they will be
 * transferred to PREPARE state and might reach STABLE state by the time
 * operation is closed.
 *
 * The main purpose of operations is to group together updates, that should be
 * simultaneously executed. Roughly speaking, an individual update can be
 * executed when its version allows so and an operation can be executed when all
 * its updates can be executed.
 *
 * Executability of an individual update U is defined as following:
 *
 *     - U's version is compared (up_cmp()) with the current version of its
 *       history (m0_dtm_history::h_hi::hi_ver). This comparison can produce one
 *       of the following outcomes:
 *
 *     - U is EARLY: the update cannot be executed at the moment, because some
 *       intermediate updates are still missing;
 *
 *     - U is LATE: the update cannot be executed, because it has already been
 *       executed (update's version is less or equal to the history version);
 *
 *     - U is READY: the update can be executed.
 *
 * Executability of an operation is checked by op_cmp() as following:
 *
 *     - if all operation updates are READY, then the operation is READY;
 *
 *     - if all operation updates are LATE, then the operation is LATE;
 *
 *     - if there are EARLY and no LATE updates, then the operation is EARLY;
 *
 *     - otherwise there are both EARLY and LATE updates and the operation is
 *       *misordered*, that is, cannot be consistently recorded in its
 *       constituent histories (op_cmp() returns MISER).
 *
 * Misordering means that DTM user violated serialisability conditions.
 *
 * When advance_op() finds late or misordered operation, it signals the user and
 * deletes the operation from DTM (removing all its updates from their
 * histories), see advance_op().
 *
 * An operation typically contains updates from 2 classes:
 *
 *     - user updates, corresponding to storage objects that DTM end-user
 *       modifies (files, directories, etc.). User updates are explicitly added
 *       to the operation by the user (before the operation is closed);
 *
 *     - control updates, used internally by DTM to organize updates in larger
 *       logical ensembles.
 *
 * For example, for each local transaction (m0_dtm_ltx) there is a corresponding
 * history (m0_dtm_ltx::lx_ch::ch_history). When an operation is executed in the
 * context of a local transaction, DTM internally adds a special "noop" update
 * (ch_noop_utype) to the operation. This noop update belongs to the local
 * transaction history. This way all operations executed in the context of the
 * local transaction are linked together and can be traced by following local
 * transaction history's list of updates. When a local transaction is closed, a
 * special "close" control update (ch_close_utype) is added to it.
 *
 * Similarly, distributed transaction (m0_dtm_dtx), domain (m0_dtm_domain) and
 * fol (m0_dtm_fol) contain embedded histories.
 *
 * An update has a label (m0_dtm_update::upd_label) unique within the update
 * operation. The label is used to identify the update and fetch it from the
 * operation after network transmission. User should assign unique labels to
 * user updates. User updates must have labels not less than
 * M0_DTM_USER_UPDATE_BASE. DTM automatically assigns unique labels to all
 * control updates (in m0_dtm_oper_close()).
 *
 * @section client-use Client use cases for DTM
 *
 * There is a DTM instance on each client. For exmaple, in an m0t1fs client,
 * m0_dtm is embedded in the super-block.
 *
 * When a client executes an application request that changes system state
 * (e.g., file write or directory creation, as opposed to read-only request like
 * file read or pathname lookup), it creates a distributed transaction for the
 * request (m0_dtm_dtx_init()). The client then creates one or more operations,
 * populates then with updates and adds operations to the transaction. Each
 * operation can include updates to multiple histories corresponding to storage
 * entities, potentially on different remote nodes. Internally, DTM adds control
 * histories and control updates to the operations.
 *
 * Updates can belong to owned or not-owned histories:
 *
 *     - when a client has an exclusive lock on some storage entity, the entity
 *       history is owned by the client DTM instance. In this case, client DTM
 *       assigns version and original version to every update to the history;
 *
 *     - when a client has no lock on an entity, it still can execute an
 *       operation on this entity. In this case, entity's history is not owned
 *       by the client and client DTM uses "unknown" (0) version number for
 *       updates to the history. When remote DTM executes the update, it assigns
 *       the version number to the update (which it can do, because it owns the
 *       history) and returns it to the client;
 *
 *     - a control history on a client can be owned. Examples are:
 *         - application domain (m0_dtm_domain), exclusively owned by the
 *           client;
 *         - "slot" shared between a client and server;
 *         - distributed transaction initiated by the client.
 *       In all these cases, the client assigns version numbers to the updates;
 *
 *     - a control history on a client can be non-owned. An example of this is
 *       the fol of a remote DTM instance. For an operation that has an update
 *       to be executed by a remote DTM instance, local client DTM adds (in
 *       m0_dtm_oper_close()) a no-op update to the remote DTM's fol
 *       (m0_dtm_fol_remote). This update has unknown version. When the
 *       operation is executed by the remote DTM, actual version number is
 *       assigned to this update and this version number is returned to the
 *       client.
 *
 * After the user added all user updates to the operation, it adds the operation
 * to the distributed transaction and closes the operation.
