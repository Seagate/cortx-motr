/**
   Standard fom phase transition function.

   This function handles standard fom phases from enum m0_fom_standard_phase.

   First do "standard actions":

   - authenticity checks: reqh verifies that protected state in the fop is
     authentic. Various bits of information in M0 are protected by cryptographic
     signatures made by a node that issued this information: object identifiers
     (including container identifiers and fids), capabilities, locks, layout
     identifiers, other resources identifiers, etc. reqh verifies authenticity
     of such information by fetching corresponding node keys, re-computing the
     signature locally and checking it with one in the fop;

   - resource limits: reqh estimates local resources (memory, cpu cycles,
     storage and network bandwidths) necessary for operation execution. The
     execution of operation is delayed if it would overload the server or
     exhaust resource quotas associated with operation source (client, group of
     clients, user, group of users, job, etc.);

   - resource usage and conflict resolution: reqh determines what distributed
     resources will be consumed by the operation execution and call resource
     management infrastructure to request the resources and deal with resource
     usage conflicts (by calling RM if necessary);

   - object existence: reqh extracts identities of file system objects affected
     by the fop and requests appropriate stores to load object representations
     together with their basic attributes;

   - authorization control: reqh extracts the identity of a user (or users) on
     whose behalf the operation is executed. reqh then uses enterprise user data
     base to map user identities into internal form. Resulting internal user
     identifiers are matched against protection and authorization information
     stored in the file system objects (loaded on the previous step);

   - distributed transactions: for operations mutating file system state, reqh
     sets up local transaction context where the rest of the operation is
     executed.

   Once the standard actions are performed successfully, request handler
   delegates the rest of operation execution to the fom type specific state
   transition function.

   Fom execution proceeds as follows:

   TODO update to reflect changes (FOPH_FOL_REC_ADD, FOPH_TXN_LOGGED_WAIT,
   absence of FOPH_FAILED)

   If a generic phase handler function fails while executing a fom, then
   it just sets the m0_fom::fo_rc to the result of the operation and returns
   M0_FSO_WAIT.  m0_fom_tick_generic() then sets the m0_fom::fo_phase to
   M0_FOPH_FAILED, logs an ADDB event, and returns, later the fom execution
   proceeds as mentioned in above diagram.

   If fom fails while executing fop specific operation, the m0_fom::fo_phase
   is set to M0_FOPH_FAILED already by the fop specific operation handler, and
   the m0_fom::fo_rc set to the result of the operation.

   @see m0_fom_phase
   @see m0_fom_phase_outcome

   @param fom, fom under execution

   @retval M0_FSO_AGAIN, if fom operation is successful, transition to next
	   phase, M0_FSO_WAIT, if fom execution blocks and fom goes into
	   corresponding wait phase, or if fom execution is complete, i.e
	   success or failure

   @todo standard fom phases implementation, depends on the support routines for
	handling various standard operations on fop as mentioned above
