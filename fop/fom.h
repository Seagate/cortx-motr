/**
 * @defgroup fom Fop state Machine
 *
 * <b>Fop state machine (fom)</b>
 *
 * A fom is a non-blocking state machine. Almost all server-side Motr
 * activities are implemented as foms. Specifically, all file system operation
 * requests, received from clients are executed as foms (hence the name).
 *
 * Fom execution is controlled by request handler (reqh) which can be thought of
 * as a specialised scheduler. Request handler is similar to a typical OS kernel
 * scheduler: it maintains lists of ready (runnable) and waiting foms. Motr
 * request handler tries to optimise utilisation of processor caches. To this
 * end, it is partitioned into a set of "localities", typically, one locality
 * for a processor core. Each locality has its own ready and waiting lists and
 * each fom is assigned to a locality.
 *
 * A fom is not associated with any particular thread: each state transition is
 * executed in the context of a certain handler thread, but the next state
 * transition can be executed by a different thread. Usually, all these threads
 * run in the same locality (on the same core), but a fom can be migrated
 * between localities for load-balancing purposes (@todo load balancing is not
 * implemented at the moment).
 *
 * The aim of interfaces defined below is to simplify construction of a
 * non-blocking file server (see HLD referenced below for a more detailed
 * exposition).
 *
 * <b>Fom phase and state</b>
 *
 * Fom operates by moving from "phase" to "phase". Current phase is recorded in
 * m0_fom::fo_phase. Generic code in fom.c pays no attention to this field,
 * except for special M0_FOM_PHASE_INIT and M0_FOM_PHASE_FINISH values used to
 * control fom life-time. ->fo_phase value is interpreted by fom-type-specific
 * code. fom_generic.[ch] defines some "standard phases", that a typical fom
 * related to file operation processing passes through.
 *
 * Each phase transition should be non-blocking. When a fom cannot move to the
 * next phase immediately, it waits for an event that would make non-blocking
 * phase transition possible.
 *
 * Internally, request handler maintains, in addition to phase, a
 * m0_fom::fo_state field, recording fom state, which can be RUNNING
 * (M0_FOS_RUNNING), READY (M0_FOS_READY) and WAITING (M0_FOS_WAITING). A fom is
 * in RUNNING state, when its phase transition is currently being executed. A
 * fom is in READY state, when its phase transition can be executed immediately
 * and a fom is in WAITING state, when no phase transition can be executed
 * immediately.
 *
 * Request handler, according to some policy, selects a fom in READY state,
 * moves it to RUNNING state and calls its m0_fom_ops::fo_tick() function to
 * execute phase transition. This function has 2 possible return values:
 *
 *     - M0_FSO_AGAIN: more phase transitions are possible immediately. When
 *       this value is returned, request handler returns the fom back to the
 *       READY state and guarantees that m0_fom_ops::fo_tick() will be called
 *       eventually as determined by policy. The reason to return M0_FSO_AGAIN
 *       instead of immediately executing the next phase transition right within
 *       ->fo_tick() is to get request handler a better chance to optimise
 *       performance globally, by selecting the "best" READY fom;
 *
 *     - M0_FSO_WAIT: no phase transitions are possible at the moment. As a
 *       special case, if m0_fom_phase(fom) == M0_FOM_PHASE_FINISH, request
 *       handler destroys the fom, by calling its m0_fom_ops::fo_fini()
 *       method. Otherwise, the fom is placed in WAITING state.
 *
 * A fom moves WAITING to READY state by the following means:
 *
 *     - before returning M0_FSO_WAIT, its ->fo_tick() function can arrange a
 *       wakeup, by calling m0_fom_wait_on(fom, chan, cb). When chan is
 *       signalled, the fom is moved to READY state. More generally,
 *       m0_fom_callback_arm(fom, chan, cb) call arranges for an arbitrary
 *       call-back to be called when the chan is signalled. The call-back can
 *       wake up the fom by calling m0_fom_ready();
 *
 *     - a WAITING fom can be woken up by calling m0_fom_wakeup() function that
 *       moves it in READY state.
 *
 * These two methods should not be mixed: internally they use the same
 * data-structure m0_fom::fo_cb.fc_ast.
 *
 * Typical ->fo_tick() function looks like
 *
 * @code
 * static int foo_tick(struct m0_fom *fom)
 * {
 *         struct foo_fom *obj = container_of(fom, struct foo_fom, ff_base);
 *
 *         if (m0_fom_phase(fom) < M0_FOPH_NR)
 *                 return m0_fom_tick_generic(fom);
 *         else if (m0_fom_phase(fom) == FOO_PHASE_0) {
 *                 ...
 *                 if (!ready)
 *                         m0_fom_wait_on(fom, chan, &fom->fo_cb);
 *                 return ready ? M0_FSO_AGAIN : M0_FSO_WAIT;
 *         } else if (m0_fom_phase(fom) == FOO_PHASE_1) {
 *                 ...
 *         } else if (m0_fom_phase(fom) == FOO_PHASE_2) {
 *                 ...
 *         } else
 *                 M0_IMPOSSIBLE("Wrong phase.");
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @see fom_long_lock.h for a higher level fom synchronisation mechanism.
 *
 * <b>Concurrency</b>
 *
 * The following types of activity are associated with a fom:
 *
 *     - fom phase transition function: m0_fom_ops::fo_tick()
 *
 *     - "top-half" of a call-back armed for a fom: m0_fom_callback::fc_top()
 *
 *     - "bottom-half" of a call-back armed for a fom:
 *       m0_fom_callback::fc_bottom()
 *
 * Phase transitions and bottom-halves are serialised: neither 2 phase
 * transitions, nor 2 bottom-halves, nor state transition and bottom-halve can
 * execute concurrently. Top-halves are not serialised and, moreover, executed
 * in an "awkward context": they are not allowed to block or take locks. It is
 * best to avoid using top-halves whenever possible.
 *
 * If a bottom-half becomes ready to execute for a fom in READY or RUNNING
 * state, the bottom-half remains pending until the fom goes into WAITING
 * state. Similarly, if m0_fom_wakeup() is called for a non-WAITING fom, the
 * wakeup remains pending until the fom moves into WAITING state.
 *
 * Fom-type-specific code should make no assumptions about request handler
 * threading model. Specifically, it is possible that phase transitions and
 * call-back halves for the same fom are executed by different
 * threads. In addition, no assumptions should be made about concurrency of
 * call-backs and phase transitions of *different* foms.
 *
 * <b>Blocking phase transitions</b>
 *
 * Sometimes the non-blockingness requirement for phase transitions is difficult
 * to satisfy, for example, if a fom has to call some external blocking code,
 * like database. In these situations, phase transition function must notify request
 * handler that it is about to block the thread executing the phase
 * transition. This is achieved by m0_fom_block_enter() call. Matching
 * m0_fom_block_leave() call notifies request handler that phase transition is
 * no longer blocked. These calls do not nest.
 *
 * Internally, m0_fom_block_enter() call hijacks the current request handler
 * thread into exclusive use by this fom. The fom remains in RUNNING state while
 * blocked. The code, executed between m0_fom_block_enter() and
 * m0_fom_block_leave() can arm call-backs, their bottom-halves won't be
 * executed until phase transition completes and fom returns back to WAITING
 * state. Similarly, a m0_fom_wakeup() wakeup posted for a blocked fom, remains
 * pending until fom moves into WAITING state. In other words, concurrency
 * guarantees listed in the "Concurrency" section are upheld for blocking phase
 * transitions.
 *
 * <b>Locality</b>
 *
 * Request handler partitions resources into "localities" to improve resource
 * utilisation by increasing locality of reference. A locality, represented by
 * m0_fom_locality owns a processor core and some other resources. Each locality
 * runs its own fom scheduler and maintains lists of ready and waiting foms. A
 * fom is assigned its "home" locality when it is created
 * (m0_fom_ops::fo_home_locality()).
 *

 * doc/motr-design-doc-list.rst
 *
 * @todo describe intended fom and reqh usage on client.
