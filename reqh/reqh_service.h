/**
   @defgroup reqhservice Request handler service
   @ingroup reqh

   A motr service is described to a request handler using a struct
   m0_reqh_service_type data structure. Every service should register its
   corresponding m0_reqh_service_type instance containing service specific
   initialisation method, service name. Once the service type is defined it
   should be registered using m0_reqh_service_type_register() and unregister
   using m0_reqh_service_type_unregister().  During service type registration,
   the service type is added to the global list of the service types maintained
   by the request handler module.  The request handler creates and initialises a
   service by invoking the constructor method of its service type, and obtains
   struct m0_reqh_service instance. The constructor should perform only internal
   house keeping tasks.  Next, the service start method is invoked, it should
   properly initialise the internal state of the service, e.g. service fops, &c.

   Request handler creates an rpc_machine for each specified end point per
   network domain. There could be multiple rpc machines running within a single
   request handler, resulting in the associated services being reachable through
   all of these end points.

   Services need to be registered before they can be started. Service
   registration can be done as below,

   First, we have to define service type operations,
   @code
   static const struct m0_reqh_service_type_ops dummy_stype_ops = {
        .rsto_service_allocate = dummy_service_allocate
   };
   @endcode

   - then define service operations,
   @code
   static const struct m0_reqh_service_ops service_ops = {
        .rso_start = service_start,
        .rso_stop  = service_stop,
        .rso_fini  = service_fini,
   };
   @endcode

   Typical service specific start and stop operations may look like below,
   @code
   static int dummy_service_start(struct m0_reqh_service *service)
   {
        ...
        rc = dummy_fops_init();
	...
   }

   static int dummy_service_stop(struct m0_reqh_service *service)
   {
	...
        dummy_fops_fini();
	...
   }
   @endcode

   - define service type,
   @code
   struct m0_reqh_service_type m0_ios_type = {
	.rst_name     = "M0_CST_IOS",
	.rst_ops      = &ios_type_ops,
	.rst_level    = M0_RS_LEVEL_NORMAL,
	.rst_typecode = M0_CST_IOS,
   };
   @endcode

   - now, the above service type can be registered as below,
   @code
   m0_reqh_service_type_register(&dummy_stype);
   @endcode

   - unregister service using m0_reqh_service_type_unregister().

   @anchor reqhservice_state_dia <b>Request Handler Service State Diagram</b>
   A typical service transitions through its states as illustrated below.
   The triggering subroutine is identified, and the service method or
   service type method invoked is shown within square braces.
