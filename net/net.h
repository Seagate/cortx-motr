/**
   @defgroup net Networking

   @brief The networking module provides an asynchronous, event-based message
   passing service, with support for asynchronous bulk data transfer (if used
   with an RDMA capable transport).

   Major data-types in M0 networking are:
   @li Network buffer (m0_net_buffer);
   @li Network buffer descriptor (m0_net_buf_desc);
   @li Network buffer event (m0_net_buffer_event);
   @li Network domain (m0_net_domain);
   @li Network end point (m0_net_end_point);
   @li Network transfer machine (m0_net_transfer_mc);
   @li Network transfer machine event (m0_net_tm_event);
   @li Network transport (m0_net_xprt);

   For documentation links, please refer to this file :
   doc/motr-design-doc-list.rst

   See RPC Bulk Transfer Task Plan for details on the design and use of this
   API.  If you are writing a transport, then the document is the reference
   for the internal threading and serialization model.

   See HLD of Motr LNet Transport for additional details on the design and
   use of this API.

    Consider:

    - The underlying transport manages message buffers. Since there is a great
      deal of concurrency and latency involved with network communication, and
      message sizes can vary, a completed (sent or received) message buffer is
      not necessarily the first that was added to its "queue" for that purpose.

    - The upper protocol layers of the <i>remote</i> end points are responsible
      for initiating bulk data transfer operations, which ultimately determines
      when passive buffers complete in <i>this</i> process.  The remote upper
      protocol layers can, and probably will, reorder requests into an optimal
      order for themselves, which does not necessarily correspond to the order
      in which the passive bulk data buffers were added.

    The fact of the matter is that the transfer machine itself
    is really only interested in tracking buffer existence and uses
    lists and not queues internally.

   All events have the following fields set:
   - nte_type
   - nte_tm
   - nte_time
   - nte_status

   The nte_type field should be referenced to determine the type of
   event, and which other fields of this structure get set:

   - M0_NET_TEV_ERROR provides error notification, out of the context of
     any buffer operation completion, or a transfer machine state change.
     No additional fields are set.

   - M0_NET_TEV_STATE_CHANGE provides notification of a transfer machine
     state change.
     The nte_next_state field describes the destination state.
     Refer to the nte_status field to determine if the operation succeeded.
     The nte_ep field is set if the next state is M0_NET_TM_STARTED; the
     value is used to set the ntm_ep field of the transfer machine.

   - M0_NET_TEV_DIAGNOSTIC provides diagnostic information.
     The nte_payload field may point to transport specific data.
     The API does not require nor specify how a transport produces
     diagnostic information, but does require that diagnostic events
     not be produced unless explicitly requested.

   that invokes the m0_net_tm_event_post() subroutine.  Applications
   should not attempt to save a reference to it from their callback
