/**
   @page LNetDLD-fspec LNet Transport Functional Specification

   - @ref LNetDLD-fspec-ds
   - @ref LNetDLD-fspec-sub

   @section LNetDLD-fspec-ds Data Structures
   The module implements a network transport protocol using the data structures
   defined by @ref net/net.h.

   The LNet transport is defined by the ::m0_net_lnet_xprt data structure.
   The address of this variable should be provided to the m0_net_domain_init()
   subroutine.


   @section LNetDLD-fspec-sub Subroutines
   New subroutine provided:
   - m0_net_lnet_ep_addr_net_cmp()
     Compare the network portion of two LNet transport end point addresses.
     It is intended for use by the Request Handler setup logic.
   - m0_net_lnet_ifaces_get()
     Get a reference to the list of registered LNet interfaces, as strings.
   - m0_net_lnet_ifaces_put()
     Releases the reference to the list of registered LNet interfaces.

   The use of these subroutines is not mandatory.

   @see @ref net "Networking"                     <!-- net/net.h -->
   @see @ref LNetDLD "LNet Transport DLD"         <!-- net/lnet/lnet_main.c -->
   @see @ref LNetDFS "LNet Transport"   <!-- below -->

 */

#include "net/net.h"

/**
   @defgroup LNetDFS LNet Transport
   @ingroup net

   The external interfaces of the LNet transport are obtained by including the
   file @ref net/lnet/lnet.h.  The ::m0_net_lnet_xprt variable represents the
   transport itself and is used as an argument to m0_net_domain_init().

   An end point address for this transport is of the form:
   @code
     NetworkIdentifierString : PID : PortalNumber : TransferMachineIdentifier
   @endcode

   For example:
   @code
     10.72.49.14@o2ib0:12345:31:0
     192.168.96.128@tcp1:12345:32:*
   @endcode
   The PID value of 12345 is used by Lustre
   in the kernel and is the only value currently supported. The symbolic
   constant ::M0_NET_LNET_PID provides this value.

   The "*" indicates a dynamic assignment of a transfer machine identifier.
   This syntax is valid only when starting a transfer machine with the
   m0_net_tm_start() subroutine; it is intended for use by ephemeral processes
   like management utilities and user interactive programs, not by servers.

   Some LNet transport idiosyncrasies to be aware of:
   - LNet does not provide any guarantees to a sender of data that the data was
     actually received by its intended recipient.  In LNet semantics, a
     successful buffer completion callback for ::M0_NET_QT_MSG_SEND and
     ::M0_NET_QT_ACTIVE_BULK_SEND only indicates that the data was successfully
     transmitted from the buffer and that the buffer can be reused.  It does
     not provide any indication if recipient was able to store the data or not.
     This makes it very important for an application to keep the unsolicited
     receive message queue (::M0_NET_QT_MSG_RECV) populated at all times.

   - Similar to the previous case, LNet may not provide indication that an end
     point address is invalid during buffer operations. A ::M0_NET_QT_MSG_SEND
     operation may succeed even if the end point provided as the destination
     address does not exist.
